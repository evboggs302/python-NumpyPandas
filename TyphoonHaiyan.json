        "content" : "Humans are capable of astonishing displays of altruism. People give their lives in battle, donate kidneys to complete strangers, and bequeath their life savings to charitable organizations. Psychologists have long sought to understand how and why people demonstrate such exceptional levels of selflessness. But as impressive as these displays are, they in fact make up only a small fraction of the good deeds people perform on a daily basisΓÇöquotidian gestures like holding a door for someone or paying someone a compliment. Or even the readiness to celebrate as friends -- that we won a game of soccer together.\n\nAlong with some colleagues, Niels Van Doesum and I have developed a line of research devoted to understanding the considerate acts that undergird social life. It is called social mindfulnessΓÇöthe practice of being cognizant of othersΓÇÖ preferences and desires, and acting accordingly. Imagine being at a bar with a friend. The bar tender informs you that they have two beers on tap, a lager and an IPA. Furthermore, only a single pint of the lager remains. Which beer would you select? If you select the lager, this will deprive your friend of the opportunity to make a choice between the beers. If you chose the IPA, your friend will still have the opportunity to chose.\n\nAccording to our research, choosing the IPA may constitute an act of social mindfulness. It signifies that you may be aware of the other personΓÇÖs preferences, and be attempting to provide them more latitude when making their own decision. This is but one instance of how social mindfulness can come into play in daily life. Other instances include giving someone the opportunity to have the last bite of cake, letting someone have ΓÇ£dibsΓÇ¥ on a car seat, or leaving space on your airplane armrest for a neighbor to share.\n\nResearch on social mindfulness has revealed some additional interesting aspects of this phenomenon. For instance, people who are socially mindful are judged more favorably by others than those who are not. This suggests that we have a natural tendency to respect and appreciate those who keep otherΓÇÖs preferences in mind when making their own decisions. In addition, brain scans of people performing social mindfulness tasks have revealed other interesting aspects of this phenomenon. The scans showed that being less socially mindful correlated with more activity in ΓÇ£prefrontal cortexΓÇ¥ regions in the brain involved with planning and deliberation.\n\nThis suggests that people may intrinsically be inclined to be socially mindful, and only through planning and deliberation do they become more self-interested. This insight fits with previous work by David Rand and his colleagues suggesting that people often engage in spontaneous forms of cooperation. It suggests that being socially mindful is the ΓÇ£default settingΓÇ¥ for people and that acting in their own interest (or against anotherΓÇÖs) takes more effort.\n\nBut what do differences in social mindfulness exactly tell us about helping that does involve costs? A recent study examined a host of variables, such as religiosity and political preferences, along with social mindfulness, to see which variables was most strongly linked to giving fundraising time to help victims of a natural disaster: the typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013. Interestingly, relative to religiosity or political preferences, social mindfulness was much more strongly linked to whether and how much time people donated to support these victims. Thus, social mindfulness is measured as low cost cooperation ΓÇô doing small things for others, like not taking away that IAP so that another person has still something to choose. But such nice gestures may also tell us a great deal about how much we help victims of a disaster far away. It seems that those with a social mind are more strongly prepared, in terms of thought and action, for costly forms of helping.\n\nStill the news about social mindfulness is not always positive. One troubling insight regarding peopleΓÇÖs tendency to be socially mindful relates to who they tend to be mindful towards. Researchers have found that people tend to be significantly more mindful of those with trustworthy-looking faces. Even more importantly, when bringing to mind an important outgroup member or somebody you do not like at all, people may deliberately take away options for the other person. For example, if professional players from a football club bring to mind a player from a rivalry football club, they tend to take away the unique item. Indeed, as I wrote in an earlier blog: people may be naturally good, but groups are not.\n\nThe researchers have called this tendency, which is the converse of social mindfulness, ΓÇ£ social hostility.ΓÇ¥ Apparently, people may be quite ready to become hostile when facing another person outside of their own tribe. This behavior is interesting because, while people may not be willing to demonstrate overt acts of aggression to out-group members, they may use more subtle acts of social hostility as a way of undermining the well-being of out-group members.\n\nOverall, research on social mindfulness has made an important step in the understanding of how small gestures matter. Sometimes, as with members of outgroups, such gestures may undermine cooperation. But most of the time, at least in the world of interactions between individuals rather than groups, small gestures promote trust and cooperation. They can be the start of a cooperative relationship or provide the critical reassurance of a trusting, cooperative relationship. These are critical insights, because presumably most of our behavior in our daily lives is not about big sacrifices, but about the small things we can do for one another.",

        "content" : "Humanitarian Crisis\n\n10 Disasters That Changed the World\n\nOver the past decade, these crises have stretched the world's ideas about what a disaster can do and how best to respond.\n\nEvery disaster has things to teach us.\n\nLooking back at a decade in which superstorms, wildfires, disease outbreaks, and monster earthquakes have taken unimaginable tolls all over the planet, itΓÇÖs easy to be overwhelmed by the scope of the problem.\n\nBut learning the lessons of every disaster, every time, is important. Every time, the world can respond more effectively ΓÇô drawing from past experiences and avoiding past mistakes. As extreme weather worsens, peopleΓÇÖs understanding of a disasterΓÇÖs scope and effect can evolve as well.\n\nDirect Relief has compiled a list of ten disasters that have changed the world over the last ten years. ItΓÇÖs not a comprehensive list, and these crises donΓÇÖt necessarily have the fastest winds or highest death count.\n\nInstead, theyΓÇÖre events that have had a profound impact on the rest of the world, challenging peopleΓÇÖs understanding of what a disaster can be, the damage it can wreak, and how to respond with better vision, awareness, and respect.\n\nHaiti earthquake (2010)\n\nEven before the magnitude 7.0 earthquake, political conflict and a faltering economy had left more than 70% of Haitians in poverty ΓÇô a cycle of instability that continues today. Infrastructure was weak, with many living in shantytowns.\n\nBut the earthquakeΓÇÖs impact was hard to fathom. More than 220,000 people ΓÇô two percent or more of the population ΓÇô were killed. One and a half million were displaced.\n\nWhile the initial turmoil was tremendous, the earthquake also revealed fault lines in international aid efforts. Decades after cholera had been eradicated from Haiti, UN peacekeepers responding to the earthquake brought a new strain of the disease with them.\n\nPeacekeepers also fathered hundreds of children, in some cases sexually abusing young girls, a recent study found. Foreign doctors treating earthquake victims were accused of performing unnecessary amputations and other problematic treatments.\n\nPartly in response to the disaster, the WHO developed new procedures for pre-vetting and approving medical teams who want to provide humanitarian aid.\n\nT┼ìhoku earthquake and tsunami, Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011)\n\nA magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the coast of Japan triggered a tsunami wave that rose 133 feet at its highest and traveled as far as six miles inland ΓÇô much larger and more powerful than expected.\n\nThat alone would have been cataclysmic enough, but the event also triggered a technological disaster on the scale of the infamous 1986 Chernobyl crisis: a series of nuclear meltdowns and a large-scale release of radioactive material from the Fukushima Daiichi power plant.\n\nAlthough estimates of the death toll vary, as many as 20,000 people were killed, in a country whose wealth and well-developed infrastructure made that number feel impossible.\n\nHurricane Sandy (2012)\n\nA predicted Category 1 storm quickly morphed into the largest hurricane on record (at the time), causing widespread havoc through the Caribbean before crashing into the United StatesΓÇÖ eastern seaboard, taking large swathes of New Jersey and New York, including New York City, offline.\n\nPeople were choked off from power and heat for days, with many trapped in high-rise buildings, unable to evacuate or procure supplies. Over 100 people died in the United States alone, many from exposure or related conditions.\n\nThe event challenged the sense of security felt by many Americans, and frenzy of media attention on seemingly invincible New York City ΓÇô itself one of the media centers of the world ΓÇô was unprecedented.\n\nTyphoon Haiyan (2013)\n\nThis Category 5 ΓÇ£super typhoonΓÇ¥ crashed into the Philippines with wind speeds hovering near 200 miles per hour ΓÇô at the time, the strongest cyclone ever. No matter what, Haiyan was going to be deadly.\n\nBut the sheer scale of disaster was difficult to fathom. The storm surge ΓÇô rising above 20 feet in some areas ΓÇô shocked the world. It swept through densely populated areas, including the major city of Tacloban, leaving devastation in its wake.\n\nThe storm killed approximately 7,000 people and displaced more than 4 million.\n\nWest Africa Ebola outbreak (2014-2016)\n\nThe deadliest Ebola outbreak in recorded history. The outbreak began in Guinea and quickly spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia ΓÇô and striking heavily in urban centers. Ebola killed more than 11,000 people ΓÇô approximately 40% of those who fell ill ΓÇô over the course of two years.\n\nThe world was horrified by the deadliness and scope of the outbreak, and developed countries were concerned for their own safety ΓÇô Ebola cases even reached the United States and Europe. The international community dove in to bolster local efforts.\n\nConcern over the deadliness of the disease also spurred more concentration on vaccines and treatments, some of which are being used in the fight against the Democratic Republic of CongoΓÇÖs current outbreak.\n\nNepal earthquake (2015)\n\nThis magnitude 7.8 earthquake destroyed homes throughout much of the country and toppled tall buildings in Kathmandu, the capital.\n\nNepalΓÇÖs weak infrastructure made the earthquake especially dangerous, but the timing of the earthquake was lucky: Because it was a Saturday afternoon, many people were outside their homes. ItΓÇÖs thought that the death toll ΓÇô nearly 9,000 ΓÇô could have been much higher.\n\nNepalΓÇÖs mountainous terrain made it difficult to access remote areas, which left many of the injured stranded while rescue workers struggled to reach them.\n\nHurricane Harvey (2017)\n\nAt its strongest, Harvey was a Category 4 storm with 130-mile-per-hour winds.\n\nBut the storm brought home an important truth: ItΓÇÖs water, not wind, thatΓÇÖs the most perilous part of a hurricane. Harvey brought trillions of gallons of rain to the southern coast, causing levels of flooding in some places that scientists only expect to see once every 500,000 years. Tens of thousands were displaced, critical access to health care was cut off, and 88 people died.\n\nHurricane Maria (2017)\n\nWhen the devastating storm hit first Dominica (as a Category 5 hurricane) and then Puerto Rico (as a Category 4), it left devastation in its wake. Both countries were plunged into darkness ΓÇô in Puerto RicoΓÇÖs case, for up to a year in some places.\n\nBut the storm drew particular attention to Puerto RicoΓÇÖs status as a United States territory. 3.4 million citizens of one of the most developed countries in the world went without power for months. The loss of power is also thought to be a major factor in many of the 3,000 deaths attributed to the storm.\n\nIn addition, federal aid was and remains slow in coming, sparking concerns about unequal treatment.\n\nCyclone Idai (2019)\n\nThe Category 3 storm crashed into southern Africa in March of this year, leaving devastation behind in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi. 1,300 people were killed; infrastructure, including many health facilities, was destroyed; and agricultural land was flooded with salty water.\n\nWhile all three countries struggle with economic and other issues, severe tropical storms ΓÇô the kind that regularly plague the Caribbean ΓÇô have not historically been a problem in southern Africa. Idai made it clear that, as the climate changes, sub-Saharan African countries will have to be aware of tropical storms and have measures in place to protect against them.\n\nGlobal wildfires (2019)\n\nSlash-and-burn agriculture caused massive, devastating wildfires in both the Amazon and Indonesia, sickening hundreds of thousands and destroying treasured forest and rainforest lands.\n\nThe blazes pitted palm oil farmers and beef ranchers against the international community, raising the question of how to meet individual needs as the world works to fight climate change and conserve valuable spaces.",

        "title" : "The Opposition are desperately using the Taal volcano eruption to make Duterte look bad",
        "content" : "In the midst of the aftermath of the recent eruption of Taal Volcano, the Opposition still havenΓÇÖt gotten over desperately trying to prove that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte doesnΓÇÖt care about the people. They have a habit of looking for him as soon as an adverse event happens and then ridicule him as soon as he shows up. WhatΓÇÖs up with that??\n\nThey tried to copy the success of the hashtag #NasaanAngPangulo which originally went viral in early 2015 when the public were outraged over the absence of then President Benigno Simeon ΓÇÿBSΓÇÖ Aquino III during the arrival of the bodies of the slain members of Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police. Recall that this was a tragedy ΓÇö the Mamasapano Massacre ΓÇö that was due to AquinoΓÇÖs negligence and recklessness in his overseeing the covert operation to capture a terrorist leader in Mindanao.\n\nThe hashtag, in the incapable hands of the Opposition today, failed to be effective against Duterte this time, however. This is because the volcanic eruption wasnΓÇÖt DuterteΓÇÖs fault and it was evident that the Opposition had a dishonest agenda in calling out for his presence on the first day of the eruption even when the situation hadnΓÇÖt at the time been properly assessed nor the extent of damage estimated as yet.\n\nEven more amazing, they were quick to slap the ΓÇ£tragedyΓÇ¥ label even before verifiable information on casualties had come in. This is so they could emotionally blackmail DuterteΓÇÖs supporters and paint the government under a negative light. Supporters of the Opposition who have a strong following on social media are always quick to jump the gun and paint the current government as ΓÇ£uncaringΓÇ¥ and slow to act.\n\nFor that matter, why would a volcanic eruption, which is a natural occurrence, make the government look incompetent? Critics were just too quick to criticise. They were already looking for a reason to hit Duterte on the very first day the volcano erupted.\n\nThe fact is, things turn ΓÇ£tragicΓÇ¥ only when people get caught up in it. In this instance, the people were evacuated in a timely manner. A lot of the animals were evacuated too. Yes, there was damage and impacted lives. Yes, there are major inconveniences. However, all these are risks inherent to people who opt to live near a live volcano ΓÇö risks that have now materialised and impacted their lives.\n\nThese obstructionists in todayΓÇÖs Opposition forget that local government units are responsible for responding first in the event of a calamity or disaster before the national government takes over. Indeed, former yellow leader Mar Roxas himself knew that. ThatΓÇÖs what he was trying to insist as then Department of Interior and Local Government Secretary in that infamous video showing him bullying Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez during a meeting at the height of the disaster caused by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013. Roxas back then was forcing Romualdez to admit he was incapable of handling the situation and to explicitly request in writing that the national government take over. Remember, Roxas famously said, ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre a Romualdez and the President is an AquinoΓÇ¥.\n\nWhen we criticised BS Aquino in 2013 in the aftermath of the Haiyan supertyphoon disaster, it was after the fact. It was after their incompetence, their lack of preparation against natural calamities, and their slow response to an emergency had become evident. Proof of this is in that infamous video of Roxas. The callousness of Roxas was on exhibit and in the spotlight. Thousands of bodies were already littered around town but he was still being pedantic. He didnΓÇÖt care. No wonder he lost the Presidential election in 2016 and lost the senatorial election in 2019. The voters did not forget his arrogance in the midst of an enormous crisis.\n\nThe Opposition are probably secretly disappointed that things turned out to be under control and their attempts at putting Duterte down had failed once again.\n\nAbout Ilda\n\nIn life, things are not always what they seem.",

WeΓÇÖre hoping against it,ΓÇ¥ national disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal told AFP.\n\nHe said at least 12 people were still listed as missing.\n\nAmong those killed were several members of a family who drowned, a policeman electrocuted by a toppled post while patrolling and a man struck by a felled coconut tree.\n\nThe Philippines is a mostly Catholic nation, and Phanfone ruined or disrupted Christmas festivities for hundreds thousands of people.\n\nThe typhoon displaced tens of thousands living on the coast and low-lying areas who were forced to celebrate Christmas in evacuation centers.\n\nOthers missed family reunions, with plane and ferry services canceled.\n\nIt also hit Boracay island, famed for its white sand beaches which draws more than a million tourists a year.\n\nCoconut trees were uprooted on Boracay and windows in some resorts were blown in during the storm, and ferry services to and from the island were cut on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nHowever no one died on Boracay, and the damage was not on the scale of badly hit coastal towns elsewhere in the central Philippines.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of around 20 storms a year.\n\nPhanfone, locally named ΓÇ£Ursula,ΓÇ¥ is the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2019.\n\nMany of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇö the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nPhanfone blew out into the South China Sea on Thursday morning.\n\nIt was tracking towards Vietnam on Friday but forecast to weaken significantly into a low pressure area well before making landfall again.\n\nLATEST ASIA PACIFIC STORIES",

Apple is not taking any commission or processing fees for the donations, which will go entirely to charity.\n\nCurrently the donation system seems to be up and running only in the United States and Australia. In both places, the donations will go to the national version of the Red Cross, although contributing specifically the Australian wildfires. Banners appear on the local Apple.com webpages, along with the local App Store.\n\nIn December, Tim Cook tweeted that Apple would make a donation to relief efforts in Australia.\n\nOur hearts are with those impacted by the Australian bushfires and with the courageous volunteer force fighting the unprecedented blazes across the countryΓÇöplease stay safe.

These include Hurricane Sandy, the Japanese Tsunami, the PhilippinesΓÇÖ Typhoon Haiyan, and far more.\n\nWhile it is possible to donate in other ways, AppleΓÇÖs page streamlines the donation process for anyone with an iTunes account. It also helps raise awareness of the issue to people who might otherwise not be prompted to donate.\n\nThe Australian bushfires are the result of record-breaking temperatures and severe drought. Thousands of firefighters and volunteers have been called into service.

        "content" : "The FinTech Alliance.ph has mobilized the entire Philippine digital industry to quickly assist the victims of the recent Taal volcano eruption which is still at alert level 4 or ΓÇÿhazardous eruptionΓÇÖ imminent in the coming days.\n\nAshfall reached more than 100 kilometers including Metro Manila leading to the closure of ManilaΓÇÖs main international airport for a day and suspension of work and classes. An estimated 15,000 villagers had been moved to evacuation centres which could further swell to hundreds of thousands more being brought to safety.\n\nTwo initiatives under the #helptaaldigital campaign were launched by the Alliance.\n\nThe first is the fund drive using all FinTech and digital channels in partnership with the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, Inc. (PDRF) co-chaired by MVP Group Chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan, Ayala Group Chairman Jaime Zobel de Ayala, and Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle.\n\nΓÇ£We are replicating what we have done before when Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban in 2013. We called on all Filipinos her and abroad to help the victims through help.ph, and they responded with dispatch. Now, we will again rally them to help the victims of this natural calamity,ΓÇ¥ FinTech Alliance chairman and RCBC Executive Vice President and Chief Innovation and Inclusion Officer Lito Villanueva said.\n\nΓÇ£PDRF welcomes this collaboration with FinTech Alliance as we optimize digital technology in mobilizing the country to help our fellow Filipinos at this time of natural disaster,ΓÇ¥ PDRF President Butch Meily said.\n\nThere are various ways to donate. Millions of Filipinos using various FinTech platforms like coins.ph, GCash, GrabPay, PayMaya and TrueMoney can send money to 0915-2939533. Another option is to transfer from any bank account to the PDRF accounts (BDO Savings Account 00-5310-36205-4 or LANDBANK Current Account 1792-1038-78) through InstaPay or PESONet.\n\nThey can also use an interoperable QR code under the recently launched QRph, the countryΓÇÖs national QR standard. The donations will be managed by PDRF for relief and rehabilitation efforts.\n\nAnother initiative is the collaboration amongst online/digital lending member-companies of the FinTech Alliance.ph. They have implemented their respective loan calamity assistance programs (such as penalty waivers and payment extensions) for those impacted by the Taal volcano eruption.\n\nOnly eligible borrowers within the PHILVOCS-defined affected areas may directly coordinate with their respective online/digital loan providers.\n\nΓÇ£This is our little way of alleviating the plight of those devastated by this recent natural calamity by optimizing all digital channels. The spirit of Bayanihan lives on,ΓÇ¥ Villanueva added.\n\nParticipating online/digital lending member-companies are Acudeen, Asialink, Ayannah, BalikBayad, BillEase, Bukas, Cashalo, CrediPros, LoanRanger, MoneyMatchPH, SeedIn, Tala, and Uploan.",

        "content" : "Lay Koon Tan: ΓÇ£No natural material comes with a technical data sheetΓÇ¥\n\nFrom bathtubs lined with eggshell, to Rolls Royce dashboards finished with iridescent tail feathers, we explore Malaysian-born Lay Koon TanΓÇÖs sustainable luxury interiors studio Nature Squared.\n\nLuxury goods have historically been defined in rarity and so donΓÇÖt typically go hand in hand with sustainable materials. From scarce ebony wood and endangered furs, to polluting tanning and dyeing methods, interior design has a fair few environmentally unfriendly vices.\n\nIn 2000, Malaysian-born interior designer Lay Koon Tan remembers ΓÇ£bemoaningΓÇ¥ the state of the design world with friends ΓÇô most people were either ΓÇ£apatheticΓÇ¥, she says, or driven by a single issue: ΓÇ£Few initiatives took a holistic multi-facetted view of sustainability balancing social, environmental and economic factors.ΓÇ¥\n\nArmed with what she identified were her ΓÇ£key driversΓÇ¥ ΓÇô a passion for nature, a desire to preserve heritage skills, to create jobs in developing countries and, of course, sustainability ΓÇô in the same year Tan launched luxury interiors studio Nature Squared.\n\nΓÇ£Community supportΓÇ¥\n\nIn the 20 years since its inception, Nature Squared has undertaken projects for the likes of Harrods and Rolls Royce, as well as releasing its own collections.\n\nSteadfast in its sustainability mission, TanΓÇÖs practice stands out from competitors for its use of unconventional materials, which she says, ΓÇ£gives value to what is availableΓÇ¥. In the past, these materials have included eggshell, tobacco, seeds, bones, termiteΓÇÖs nests and feathers.\n\nWhen it comes to sourcing such materials, Tan says the task isnΓÇÖt as difficult as one might think. ΓÇ£We start with the communities we want to support,ΓÇ¥ she says, explaining the Nature Squared team sources materials from across Asia, Africa and Europe. ΓÇ£Sourcing the materials is not the main challenge, since we start with our source communities.ΓÇ¥\n\nCapiz shell, for example, is collected as a waste product from the worldΓÇÖs shellfishing industries; eggshell is collected from local bakeries and farms; and fast-growing vines and reeds are harvested locally and sustainably by indigenous peoples.\n\nΓÇ£Nothing is ever the same twiceΓÇ¥\n\nThe companyΓÇÖs main production facilities are in the Philippines, a place Tan says, ticks multiple boxes. ΓÇ£When we looked for a base for our business, one of our key prerequisites was a good level of craft skill,ΓÇ¥ she explains, adding this was key to emphasise the nature-human link within products.\n\nTo ensure these unusual, and oftentimes delicate, materials come together to make something fit for the luxury interiors market, all training is undertaken in-house.\n\nΓÇ£Working with the natural materials comes with myriad challenges,ΓÇ¥ says Tan. ΓÇ£No natural material comes with a technical data sheet ΓÇô nothing is ever the same twice.ΓÇ¥\n\nShe continues: ΓÇ£[We felt] it an absolute necessity to combat the mistaken view that developing countries are primarily a source of cheap labour and low-quality products to fuel consumer spending in richer countries.ΓÇ¥\n\nIn contrast, Tan explains her mission is to give indigenous craft skills and labour the recognition it deserves. Where many communities may have been pushed to adopt more ΓÇ£westernΓÇ¥ work ideals, valuing office-based work over craftsmanship for example, she explains the Nature Squared mission is to ΓÇ£demonstrate that the enhancing of heritage handskills confers dignity and worth, as well as ensuring cultural continuity and development.ΓÇ¥\n\nIn 2013 and in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, this philosophy saw Tan seek out a group of indigenous weavers in the Cebu region of the Philippines. The move had the two-fold effect of preserving a craft that was in danger of being lost through a living archive of skills, while also ensuring an income for affected families.\n\nΓÇ£Too idealisticΓÇ¥\n\nWith todayΓÇÖs standards and knowledge, TanΓÇÖs mission ΓÇô to craft furniture with sustainable materials and properly remunerate the people involved in the process ΓÇô appears responsible and reasonable. But she says attitudes were not nearly so favourable when Nature Squared launched: ΓÇ£People honestly thought we were mad to have sustainability at the core of our business ΓÇô [often], we had to explain what the term meant.\n\nΓÇ£Twenty years ago, it wasnΓÇÖt something brands really understood, let alone communicated. I particularly recall a well-known designer telling us with furrowed brow that we were ΓÇÿtoo idealisticΓÇÖ.ΓÇ¥\n\nRather than seeing it as exclusive, Tan views Nature SquaredΓÇÖs luxury mission as ΓÇ£sugar-coating the pillΓÇ¥.

        "title" : "Commanding the carrier ΓÇô a brief history of HMS Queen ElizabethΓÇÖs captains | Save the Royal Navy",
        "content" : "January 21, 2020\n\nCommanding the carrier ΓÇô a brief history of HMS Queen ElizabethΓÇÖs captains\n\nIn January 2020 the 4th seagoing captain of HMS Queen Elizabeth was appointed. As the ship has only been in commission for just over two years and is not yet operational there was some surprise at the high turnover of commanding officers. Here we provide some background and context to the most high profile job in the navy.\n\nCaptain Simon Petitt (2012 ΓÇô May 16)\n\nSimon Petitt was appointed as the Senior Naval Officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth while the ship was still in the early phases of construction. As an experienced weapon engineering officer who has previously served in HMS Ark Royal, his job was to oversee the build up of the shipΓÇÖs company from just 9 sailors when he joined, to 580 when he left. As a completely new ship, fundamentally different to anything the Royal Navy had ever had before, he took on a daunting task to establish procedures and routines almost from scratch. Although not responsible for delivering the ship itself, he had to ensure that the contractors commissioning and testing staff gradually handed over responsibility to the sailors and passed on the technical understanding of the shipΓÇÖs systems. Pettit was never slated to take the ship to sea but would lay the foundations for the first seagoing captain, a task he successfully completed before handing over to Jerry Kyd.\n\nCaptain Jerry Kyd (May 16 ΓÇô Oct 18)\n\nJerry Kyd was appointed the captain designate of HMS Queen Elizabeth in February 2014 but did not assume command until 2016. Although already promoted to Commodore, he followed historical custom and routinely wore the rank of Captain while commanding the carrier. As the last captain of HMS Ark Royal (September 2010 ΓÇô March 2011) his first difficult job was to inform the ShipΓÇÖs Company that the ship was to be decommissioned. He then had to maintain standards and morale for six months until bringing the ship into Portsmouth for the final time with considerable dignity. He subsequently commanded the surviving CVS, HMS Illustrious for a year bringing her out of out of refit in May 2011 and operating in the helicopter carrier role. As an exceptional officer with a carrier background, he was an obvious candidate to take on the heavy responsibility of commanding QE, a role that involved great pressures while being subject to considerable public attention.\n\nKyd led the ship as she completed a number of major ΓÇÿfirstsΓÇÖ for the carrier programme including making the tricky exit from Rosyth in June 2017, conducting initial sea trials and entering Portsmouth for the first time. His final task was to take the ship on its first major deployment to the US in 2018. He had the confidence to allow documentary film-maker Chris Terrill on board to record the ups and downs of the ship entry into service. In the public eye, he maintained patience and grace during multiple rounds of media interviews which included questions from journalists that could sometimes be frustratingly ignorant or mildly hostile.\n\nThose who served with Jerry Kyd say he always kept a cool head even when those around him were getting flustered under pressure and was well-liked and respected by all ranks. He completed his time in command in October 2018, handing over to his successor Captain Nick Cooke-Priest while the ship was anchored in the spectacular surroundings of New York Harbour. His overwhelmingly successful time in charge was endorsed by immediate promotion to Rear Admiral and his current appointment as Fleet Commander.\n\nCaptain Nick Cooke-Priest (Oct 18 ΓÇô May 19)\n\nA former Lynx helicopter observer, Nick Cooke-Priest was promoted to captain in 2014 and was appointed to Command the fleet flagship HMS Bulwark in 2015. He was subsequently awarded an OBE for the shipΓÇÖs work during the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. After taking command of HMS Queen Elizabeth in the US and completing the second phase of F-35 developmental flying trials, he sailed her back to the UK but the ship spent the majority of his time in command alongside having maintenance and upgrades. After the ship arrived in Rosyth for dry docking in May 2019 it was announced he was abruptly being removed from command.\n\nThe RN stated that he had allowed his wife to make use of the shipΓÇÖs car, a Ford Galaxy, in contravention of the rules. It was not the first time he had been warned about infringement of similar regulations and it has emerged he was reported on by members of his own crew. The misdemeanours of the CO put the RN leadership in a difficult position. It is important that officers are treated the same as junior sailors who have broken the rules and this issue could not simply be overlooked, especially as it was not the first time. Unfortunately, the sacking attracted withering criticism from many outsiders who perceived it as an excessive sanction for a trivial offence. (Although not any kind of excuse, by comparison, someone in a job with equivalent responsibility in a private company would probably receive remuneration far greater than a CaptainΓÇÖs salary of around ┬ú95k, and likely have a generous package of benefits, including a good company car.)\n\nHad he done things differently it is likely he would still be in command, possibly not handing over until mid-2021. Nick Cooke-Priest decided to leave the navy in June 2019, a disappointing end to a promising naval career.\n\nSteve Moorhouse (May 19 ΓÇô Jan 20)\n\nThe unplanned vacancy caused by the removal of the CO meant the RN had to find a suitable replacement quickly. It had been the intention that Moorhouse would be the first seagoing captain of HMS Prince of Wales after his appointment on 6th September 2018. Instead, he was transferred to take over HMS Queen Elizabeth at short notice. Moorhouse is another aviator and had a background serving as an observer in Airborne Early Warning Sea Kings. He also had recent capital ship experience as CO of HMS Ocean during her tenure as NATOΓÇÖs High Readiness Command platform (2015-17).\n\nCaptain MoorhouseΓÇÖs ΓÇÿpierhead jumpΓÇÖ proved to be an opportunity for Commander Darren Huston who was serving as the XO (Executive Officer / second in command) of QE. He was promoted and transferred to take command of HMS Prince of Wales, where his previous experience gained onboard her older sister would be especially valuable.\n\nCaptain Moorhouse led QE through Operational Sea Training in (May ΓÇô June) and dealt with the internal flooding incident that hastened her return to Portsmouth in early July. The main achievement of his time in command was leading the ship through the highly successful Westlant 19 (Aug ΓÇô Dec) deployment. His relatively short time in charge ended in January 2020 when was promoted and replaced Commodore Mike Utley as Commander UK Carrier Strike Group (COMUKCSG).\n\nCaptain Angus Essenhigh (Jan 2020 ΓÇô ?)\n\nAngus Essenhigh has previously served on exchange with the US Navy as navigator of the destroyer USS Winston S. Churchill. He commanded HMS Daring during her epic Pacific 2013 deployment and was awarded an OBE for the ships aid work in the Philippines following the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan. He also captained ice patrol ship HMS Protector during two seasons in Antarctica. The name may be familiar to the older generation, his father, Sir Nigel Essenhigh was First Sea Lord (Jan 2001-Dec 2002) a tenure that included signing up to the Joint Strike Fighter programme which delivered the F-35.\n\nAs is more usual for officer appointments, Captain Essenhigh is likely to remain in post for at least two years and he will oversee the transformation from lengthy trials and workup process into becoming a fully operational warship. The shipΓÇÖs lead role in the Carrier Strike Group deployment beginning in May 2021 will be high profile and attract global interest. He has landed the prime sea-going job in the RN at an especially exciting moment.\n\nThe RN is fortunate to have a cadre of talented officers ready to step up to the major challenge of commanding aircraft carriers in the coming years. Of course, it should be appreciated that while the captain carries the final responsibility and sets the tone, it is the shipΓÇÖs company in its entirety that is ultimately responsible for success.",

        "content" : "Australia is burning. Seasons are getting pushed, and the cold wave in India is the worst it's been in years. And the Amazon that really deserves our attention is in the south of America. Do we need more reason to care about climate change? Whether you have your homework done on saving our planet or are a novice to the debate, there exists an ocean of content on Netflix to help you become a better samaritan. Here are some of our top picks if you want to familiarise yourself with the realities of climate change. Our Planet Narrated by David Attenborough, this multimillion-dollar eight-part series focuses on a different ecosystem in every episode. The incredibly shot visuals of glaciers crashing into the sea, desolate shots of once-thriving marine-scapes, and satellite views of the EarthΓÇÖs population doubling in number serve as a shuddering reminder of the climate crisis weΓÇÖre facing today. Chasing Coral For this 93-minute documentary, directors Jeff Orlowski and Richard Vevers gathered a team of researchers to manually capture the changing face of the bleak coral reefs in the Caribbean islands, Hawaii and Australia , through detailed time-lapse camera rigs. Decoding The Weather Machine Are you one of the skeptics who still needs more convincing that climate change is real? If nostalgic before-and-after shots of our planet make you cynical, maybe some science-backed evidence is what you need. PBS NOVAΓÇÖs two-hour film documents how scientists investigate and arrive at the conclusion that climate change is, in fact, very much a reality. An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is the successor to An Inconvenient Truth , Al GoreΓÇÖs 2006 documentary about climate change . In an effort to raise the stakes for the future of our planet, Gore touches on landmark disasters in the planetΓÇÖs history in this 2017 film, including Hurricane Sandy, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the wildfire in Fort McMurray, Canada, the Zika virus, and probably the most disastrous of them all ΓÇôΓÇôTrumpΓÇÖs announcement of the United StatesΓÇÖ withdrawal from The Paris Agreement. A Plastic Ocean Shot over four year across 20 locations, filmmakers Craig Leeson and Tanya Streeter make the devastating discovery of a thick layer of plastic debris in the middle of the Indian Ocean in this 2016 film, and subsequently document its impact on marine life. The heart-wrenching footage of deteriorating sea life is complemented by a look at the concrete steps we can take in our day-to-day lives to reverse the tide for our planetΓÇÖs oceans.

The storm left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nMore than 23,000 ferry passengers trying to get home for the Christmas holidays have been stranded at ports as shipping shut down, the coast guard said Tuesday.\n\nThe state weather service said Phanfone would bring moderate to strong winds over the capital Manila on Christmas Day.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific cyclone belt.\n\nAs such, the archipelago gets hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year.\n\nStrong winds and associated dangers such as floods, landslides, and ΓÇö more rarely ΓÇö giant walls of seawater kill scores of people each year, wipe out harvests and destroy roads, bridges, power lines and other infrastructure.\n\nA July 2019 study by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank said the most frequent storms lop 1 percent off the Philippine economic output, with the stronger ones cutting output by nearly 3 percent.\n\nLATEST ASIA PACIFIC STORIES\n\nExhibition in China reflects on loss of anonymity to recognition technology An art exhibition exploring the impact of facial recognition technology has opened in China, offering a rare public space for reflection on increasingly pervasive surveillance by tech companies ...\n\nAmerican newlyweds are 'progressing' from volcano burns The families of American newlyweds who were badly injured during a volcanic eruption in New Zealand said Tuesday the two are progressing as well as could be hoped for given the extent of their inju...\n\nFormer Trump adviser John Bolton warns of 'imminent' North Korea risk Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump's North Korea policy, warning that the Asian country posed an \"imminent\" threat. \"The...",

        "content" : "Asia Pacific\n\nSix missing as island-hopping typhoon brings misery for Philippines on Christmas Day\n\nAFP-JIJI\n\nDec 26, 2019 Dec 26, 2019  Dec 26, 2019\n\nMANILA ΓÇô Typhoon Phanfone pummeled the central Philippines on Christmas Day, bringing a wet, miserable and terrifying holiday to millions in the mainly Catholic nation.\n\nPolice said six people were missing as the typhoon leaped from one small island to another for the second day ΓÇö crumpling houses, toppling trees and blacking out cities and towns, including in popular resorts like Boracay.\n\nAt the height of the festive season on Wednesday, tens of thousands were stranded at shuttered ports or evacuation centers while the rest of the regionΓÇÖs population cowered in rain-soaked homes.\n\nThough weaker, Phanfone was tracking a similar path to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the countryΓÇÖs deadliest cyclone on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nA father, his three children and two other relatives were missing after their hut was swept away early Wednesday when heavy rain caused a creek to overflow near the town of Balasan, provincial police told AFP.\n\nMore than 16,000 people spent the night in improvised shelters in schools, gyms and government buildings as the typhoon first made landfall Tuesday, civil defense officials said.\n\nΓÇ£It was frightening. The glass windows shattered and we took cover by the stairs,ΓÇ¥ Ailyn Metran told AFP after she and her four-year-old child took refuge at the state weather service office in Tacloban city, where her husband worked.\n\nThe typhoon ripped a metal window frame off the building and dropped it onto a car parked outside, she said.\n\nWith just two hoursΓÇÖ sleep, the family were relieved to find their two dogs safe back home Wednesday, though the floor was covered in mud and a felled tree rested atop a nearby house.\n\nOther survivors posted pictures and videos on social media of crushed homes, buses half-submerged by brown floodwater, roads strewn with tree trunks, and coconut and banana plants being shredded by ferocious winds.\n\nWith sustained gusts of 195 kph (121 mph) ΓÇö which can knock down small trees and destroy flimsy houses ΓÇö the typhoon was on track to hit the island resort of Coron overnight, the weather service said.\n\nCoronΓÇÖs beaches emptied and boat tours were suspended on Christmas Day as Western tourists stayed indoors ahead of the onslaught.\n\nΓÇ£Many of the tourist establishments here are closed, and some of our guests failed to arrive because their flights were canceled,ΓÇ¥ hotel receptionist Nina Edano told AFP by phone.\n\nΓÇ£WeΓÇÖre not scared, but the ambience here is generally gloomy,ΓÇ¥ she added.\n\nThe typhoon hit land as millions of Filipinos trooped to once-yearly clan reunions centered on the ΓÇ£noche buena,ΓÇ¥ a sumptuous midnight meal that is the highlight of the Catholic nationΓÇÖs holidays.\n\nMore than 25,000 people remained stranded at ports on Christmas Day with ferry services still shut down, the coast guard said.\n\nScores of flights to the region also remained canceled, though the populous capital Manila has so far been spared.\n\nΓÇ£Obviously, (local residents) were unable to celebrate Christmas properly because some spent the night at evacuation centers,ΓÇ¥ rescue official Cecille Bedonia told AFP by phone from Iloilo city.\n\nOn the north of the island of Cebu, residents decamping from evacuation centers were greeted by the sorry sight of their damaged homes on Christmas Day, civil defense official Allen Froilan Cabaron told AFP.\n\nΓÇ£They were safer at the evacuation centers. At least they were able to eat the Christmas Eve meal there, even if only tinned fish and instant noodles were available,ΓÇ¥ Cabaron said.\n\nΓÇ£But ΓÇª the atmosphere would have been different because they were not at home,ΓÇ¥ Cabaron added.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific cyclone belt. It is hit by about 20 storms and typhoons each year that kill scores of people and wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions perennially poor.\n\nA recent study by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank said the most frequent storms lop 1 percent off the PhilippinesΓÇÖ economic output, with the stronger ones cutting GDP by nearly 3 percent.\n\nLATEST ASIA PACIFIC STORIES",

        "content" : "A RoguesΓÇÖ Gallery of the Five Category 5 Storms of 2019\n\nThe two Atlantic Category 5 hurricanes and three Northwest Pacific Category 5 super typhoons of 2019 set records\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare via\n\nPrint\n\nFive Category 5 tropical cyclones troubled EarthΓÇÖs tropical waters in 2019--two hurricanes in the Atlantic: Dorian (185 mph) and Lorenzo (160 mph), and three super typhoons in the Northwest Pacific: Wutip (160 mph), Hagibis (160 mph), and Halong (180 mph). Earth averaged 5.3 Category 5 storms per year between 1990 and 2018, according to ratings made by NOAA's National Hurricane Center and the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center, so 2019ΓÇÖs activity was near-average. Cat 5 activity over the previous five years (except for 2017) had been much above average, though (Figure 1).\n\nOne of 2019ΓÇÖs Cat 5s made landfall at category 5 strengthΓÇöHurricane Dorian in The Bahamas, with 185 mph winds, which tied for third place for the worldΓÇÖs strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in recorded history. Two of the Cat 5s of 2019 ended up being billion-dollar disasters: Hurricane Dorian, with nearly $10 billion in damage in The Bahamas, Leeward Islands, U.S., and Canada; and Typhoon Hagibis, with $15 billion in damage to JapanΓÇöJapanΓÇÖs second most expensive typhoon in history. Below is a rogues gallery of all five Category 5 storms of 2019.\n\nSuper Typhoon Wutip: first February Cat 5 ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere\n\nThe first Cat 5 of 2019 was Typhoon Wutip, which passed over Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Yap states in the Federated States of Micronesia from February 19 - 22 as a Category 2 typhoon with sustained winds of 100 mph, causing at least $2 million in damage. On February 23, an intensifying category 3 Wutip passed about 180 miles southwest of Guam, bringing southern Guam sustained tropical storm-force winds, torrential rains of 8 ΓÇô 12ΓÇ¥, and waves up to 20 feet high. Damage in Guam was estimated at $1.3 million.\n\nWutip then underwent an impressive burst of rapid intensification in the waters approximately 300 miles west of Guam, topping out as category 5 super typhoon with a central pressure of 915 mb and sustained winds of 160 mph at 6 GMT February 25. This made Wutip the first Category 5 storm ever observed in the Northern Hemisphere in the month of February. Wutip did not affect any land areas after passing Guam.\n\nHurricane Dorian: third strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in world history\n\nAfter hitting St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands as a category 1 hurricane on August 28 and causing $150 million in damage to the Caribbean islands, Hurricane Dorian rapidly intensified into a category 5 mega-hurricane that powered ashore on Great Abaco Island in The Bahamas on September 1, 2019 with sustained winds of 185 mph. This puts Dorian in a tie for third strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in world history. Ominously, eight of the top ten strongest landfalling tropical cyclones in world history have occurred since 2006 (as estimated using wind speed estimates from the National Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center):\n\n1. Super Typhoon Haiyan, 190 mph, 2013 (Samar, Philippines)  1. Super Typhoon Meranti, 190 mph, 2016 (Itbayat, Philippines) 3. Hurricane Dorian, 185 mph, 2019 (Bahamas) 3. Super Typhoon Joan, 185 mph, 1959 (Taiwan)  3. Great Labor Day Hurricane, 185 mph, 1935 (Florida, U.S.)  6. Super Typhoon Yutu, 180 mph, 2018 (Northern Mariana Islands, U.S.)  6. Hurricane Irma, 180 mph, 2017 (Leeward Islands)  6. Cyclone Winston, 180 mph, 2016 (Fiji)  6. Super Typhoon Megi, 2010, 180 mph (Luzon, Philippines)  6. Super Typhoon Zeb, 1998, 180 mph (Luzon, Philippines)  6. Cyclone Monica, 2006, 180 mph (Australia)\n\nAt landfall, Dorian was moving at just 5 mph, and portions of DorianΓÇÖs eyewall lashed Great Abaco and Grand Bahama islands with Category 5 winds for a total of 22 hours before the great hurricane finally weakened to Category 4 strength. DorianΓÇÖs extreme winds, storm surge of 20 ΓÇô 25 feet, and rains of up to 3 ft (0.9 m) of rain combined to bring the Bahamas their most devastating natural disaster in history. A November 15 report from the Inter-American Development Bank put damage in The Bahamas from Dorian at $3.4 billionΓÇöover 25% of their $12 billion GDP, and their most expensive disaster in history. Insurance broker Aon put DorianΓÇÖs damages at over $8 billion. Dorian killed 70 and left 300 people missing in The Bahamas, according to reliefweb.com.\n\nDorianΓÇÖs stall allowed the hurricaneΓÇÖs winds to upwell enough cool water to significantly weaken the storm, and the hurricane made landfall on September 6 at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane with 90 mph winds and a minimum central pressure of 956 mb. Dorian killed ten people in the U.S., cost $1.4 billion, and spawned a political firestormΓÇöSharpiegateΓÇöafter President Trump incorrectly tweeted on September 1 that Alabama would ΓÇ£most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.ΓÇ¥\n\nDorian also hit Canada hard, making landfall in eastern Nova Scotia on September 7 as an extratropical cyclone with Category 2 winds of 100 mph and a pressure of 958 mb, making it the third strongest hurricane or ex-hurricane on record to hit Canada. Damage in Canada was estimated at $200 million.\n\nHURRICANE LORENZO BECOMES THE EASTERNMOST ATLANTIC CAT 5 AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE AZORES STORM ON RECORD\n\nHurricane Lorenzo intensified into a category 5 hurricane with 160 mph winds at 45┬░W on September 29, becoming the easternmost Atlantic category 5 storm on record. Lorenzo spent 3 ┬╜ days as a major hurricane east of 45┬░WΓÇöthe longest period of time on record that a major Atlantic hurricane has existed so far to the east (previous record: 1.75 days by Hurricane Carrie in 1957).\n\nThe French ocean tug Bourbon Rhode capsized in huge waves spawned by Lorenzo on September 27; among its fourteen crew members, eleven were killed. Throughout late September and early October, huge swells radiated from the hurricane's massive wind field, impacting much of the Atlantic basin. More that 2000 miles west of the storm, eight people drowned in rip currents along the U.S. coast.\n\nA weakening Lorenzo passed 55 miles north of Flores Island in the Azores on October 2 as a Category 1 hurricane with 90 mph winds. Lorenzo brought sustained hurricane-force winds of 74 mph to nearby Corvo Island. Winds of this strength have rarely been experienced in the Azores, and Lorenzo caused major damage, particularly on Flores. The government estimated damage at $367 million--primarily to port infrastructureΓÇömaking Lorenzo the costliest hurricane in Azores history. According to EM-DAT (the international disaster database) and National Hurricane Center storm summaries, there are no records of any other hurricane causing significant damage in the Azores.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis--JapanΓÇÖs second most expensive typhoon in history, at $15 billion\n\nSuper Typhoon Hagibis peaked as a category 5 storm with 160 mph winds and a central pressure of 904 mb on October 10 in the waters southwest of Japan. High wind shear and cooler waters caused Hagibis to weaken as it headed toward Japan, but the massive typhoon still caused JapanΓÇÖs second most expensive typhoon strike in history after roaring ashore in the Nagano prefecture on October 12, 2019 as a category 2 storm with 100 mph winds. Hagibis tracked over the Tokyo metropolitan area and unleashed unprecedented rains and catastrophic flooding across much of Japan, and was the wettest typhoon in JapanΓÇÖs history, with 922.5 mm (36.3ΓÇ¥) of rain falling in 24 hours at Hakone. Hagibis killed 98 and caused over $15 billion in damage, making it EarthΓÇÖs most expensive weather-related disaster of 2019. Hagibis came just two months after the landfall of Typhoon Faxai, which also made landfall as a category 2 storm and tracked over Tokyo. Faxia did $7 billion in damage, making it JapanΓÇÖs seventh most expensive typhoon on record.\n\nAccording to inflation-adjusted damage estimates from Aon and EM-DAT, three of the top ten most damaging Japanese typhoons since 1950 have occurred since 2018. A fourth typhoon, Trami of 2018, with $4.6 billion in damage, just missed making the list:\n\nMireille, 1991, $19.1 billion Hagibis, 2019, $15 billion Jebi, 2018, $12.6 billion  Songda, 2004, $12.5 billion  Flo, 1990, $8.0 billion  Bart, 1999, $7.8 billion Faxai, 2019, $7.0 billion  Vera, 1959, $5.3 billion (5098 deaths)  Sarah, 1986, $5.1 billion  Vicki, 1998, $4.8 billion\n\nThis list does not include the $10.2 billion flood disaster in southern Japan in July 2018, which was caused by the presence of a stationary seasonal frontal boundary enhanced by remnant moisture from Typhoon Prapiroon. Hurricane scientists agree that typhoons in the Northwest Pacific are reaching their maximum intensities at a more northerly latitude than they used to, which has increased the typhoon risk to Japan. In a 2019 review paper by 11 hurricane scientists,  Tropical Cyclones and Climate Change Assessment: Part I. Detection and Attribution, nine of 11 authors concluded that the balance of evidence suggested that human-caused climate change contributed to the observed poleward migration of more intense typhoons.\n\nSuper Typhoon Halong: 8th strongest tropical cyclone in world history?\n\nThe final Cat 5 of 2019 was Super Typhoon Halong, which peaked at 180 mph winds and a central pressure of 897 mb at 18 GMT November 5, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). They classify a typhoon with winds that strong every two years or so. As I discussed in a  November 8 post, a truly eye-opening estimate of HalongΓÇÖs intensity came from an independent assessment using an advanced satellite technique developed by scientists at the University of Wisconsin. That method, called the Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT), is more suitable for generating ratings to compare historical storms with. The ADT rated Halong as having 192 mph winds,  making it the eighth strongest tropical cyclone seen worldwide since the era of reliable satellite measurements began in 1979.\n\nThe almost-Cat 5 of 2019\n\nTwo other tropical cyclones just missed achieving Category 5 status in 2019, topping out with 155 mph winds (157 mph winds are the threshold for a Cat 5): Cyclone Fani in the North Indian Ocean on May 2, and Cyclone Ambali in the Southwest Indian Ocean. Ambali is notable for setting a mark for the  largest 24-hour intensification on record in the Southern Hemisphere, after it jumped from 35 knots (40 mph) to 135 knots (155 mph) in just 24 hours. The previous record was 95 knots (110 mph) from Cyclone Ernie in 2017. AmbaliΓÇÖs intensification mark falls just short of the world record for 24-hour intensification  set by Hurricane Patricia of 2015 of 105 knots (120 mph), when the storm was off the Pacific coast of Mexico.\n\nARE THE STRONGEST TROPICAL CYCLONES GETTING STRONGER?\n\nTheory suggests that a warming climate should make the strongest tropical cyclones stronger, since hurricanes are heat engines that extract heat energy from the oceans, converting it to kinetic energy in the form of wind. In a 2019 Review Paper by 11 hurricane scientists, ΓÇ£Tropical Cyclones and Climate Change Assessment: Part I. Detection and AttributionΓÇ¥, ten of 11 authors concluded that the balance of evidence suggests that there is a detectable increase in the global average intensity of global hurricanes since the early 1980s; eight of 11 authors concluded that the balance of evidence suggests that human-caused climate change contributed. All 11 authors agreed that the balance of evidence suggests that the proportion of all hurricane reaching Category 4-5 strength has increased in recent years; eight of 11 authors concluded that the balance of evidence suggests that human-caused climate change contributed.

        "title" : "Top 40 news stories of the 2010s",
        "content" : "In the 2000s, deemed as the beginning of the 21st century, the internet progressively transitioned into a globalized superpower of modernized communication, fueling the rise of tech giants such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nDuring that decade, mass extinction consequences and unprecedented acts of terrorism, unlike anything attested before in modern history, dominated headlines. Nearing the end of that decade, an international financial crisis took shape, profoundly impacting economic growth, on a global scale.\n\nWhile many major events reverberated into the succeeding decade, like the War on Terror and the surge of social media, some cheered buoyant standpoints of the 21st centuryΓÇÖs second decade.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, the world stood and witnessed the integral growth of social media and the Internet of Things (IoT), giving us a glimpse of our technological future. Arguably the most captivating, controversial, and persistently covered news topic in mass media was TrumpΓÇÖs rise to political power as a world leader.\n\nBut the immense news coverage of TrumpΓÇÖs occupation at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave was only a drop in the ocean of the many polemical headlines. Extraordinary advancements were made in all sectors of science, tech, and entertainment.\n\nBy the end of this decade, we lost indelible public figures, like George H.W. Bush, Nelson Mandela, Muammar al-Gaddafi, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Kim Jong-il, Whitney Houston, Steve Jobs, Muhammad Ali, Neil Armstrong, Stephen Hawking ΓÇö just to name a few.\n\nIn this excerpt, we scoured through the depths of the web and compiled a list of the decadeΓÇÖs top headlines. Here are the 40 biggest news stories of the 2010s.\n\n40. North Korea Assails Yeonpyeong Island (2010)\n\nFact Check\n\nAccurate Reporting\n\nOn November 23rd, 2010, tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalated after South Korean forces engaged in military exercises on Yeonpyeong Island, prompting an exchange of artillery shells and rockets.\n\nThe incident resulted in the death of four South Koreans and 22 injuries, according to reports. It is considered the most dangerous confrontation since both conflicting nations signed the 1953 armistice.\n\n39. Chilean Mining Accident (2010)\n\nFact Check\n\nAccurate Reporting\n\nIn northern Chile, a San Jos├⌐ mine collapse left 33 men trapped 700 meters underground. ΓÇ£Estamos bien en el refugio, los 33,ΓÇ¥ a note stated in Spanish, as rescue workers tried to pull the miners up to the surface.\n\nThe incident lasted 69 days, with the Chilean government ministry, NASA, and numerous corporations having contributed to the rescue effort. Around 1 billion people watched as the trapped miners were brought back up, one by one, safely, with no casualties.\n\n38. WikiLeaks Releases War Cables (2010)\n\nFact Check\n\nAccurate Reporting\n\nThroughout 2010, the non-profit organization WikiLeaks publicized an enormous amount of classified diplomatic cables of the War on Terror. Over 75,000 classified documents on the Afghan War were leaked to The Guardian, The New York Times, and Der Spiegel; with the Times calling the data ΓÇ£one of the biggest leaks in U.S. military history.ΓÇ¥\n\nThereafter, an even larger document dump was made, over 391,000 of the Iraq War, alleging war crimes and human rights abuses. Julian Assange, the organizationΓÇÖs editor-in-chief at the time, dubbed the leaks as ΓÇ£the most comprehensive history of a war ever to be published, during the course of the war.ΓÇ¥\n\n37. Deepwater Horizon Explosion & Spill (2010)\n\nFact Check\n\nSome Misinformation\n\nIn Spring of 2010, the Gulf of Mexico, located just south of Louisiana, experienced the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. The environmental disaster originated from a drilling rig explosion on the Deepwater Horizon semi-submersible Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit. 11 workers were killed by the subsequent fire, leading to the spilling of 4.9 million barrels or 210 million gallons of oil into the ocean.\n\nFederal charges, including manslaughter and lying to congress, were filed against the British multinational gas company BP. In September 2014, a U.S. District Judge ruled that BP beared responsibility for the incident and agreed to settle it for $18.7 billion, the largest corporate settlement in U.S. history.\n\n36. Historic Earthquake Strikes Haiti (2010)\n\nFact Check\n\nAccurate Reporting\n\nIn this decade, one of the deadliest natural disasters occurred near Port-au-Prince, in HaitiΓÇÖs capital. On Tuesday, January 12th, 2010, a strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook the island causing untold destruction that would leave behind a death toll between 230,000 to 316,000, based on estimates by the Haitian government.\n\nThe immediate aftermath prompted relief efforts from many countries, with over $1 billion collected, in total, between 23 major charities.\n\n35. Fukushima Nuclear Plant Accident (2011)\n\nFact Check\n\nAccurate Reporting\n\nIn the 1990s, and leading up to 2011, experts at the International Atomic Energy Agency warned of a possible catastrophe regarding JapanΓÇÖs nuclear plants and its inability to withstand seismic disasters. In March 2011, the island of T┼ìhoku was rocked by the most powerful earthquake in JapanΓÇÖs history, measuring a magnitude of 9.1, triggering tsunami waves at an excess of 133 ft. The quake caused a Level 7 nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the most intense incident since the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nIn totality, the 2011 T┼ìhoku earthquake and tsunami is estimated to have caused around $411 billion (USD) in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in modern history. Clean up efforts at the affected power plant are expected to last 30 to 40 years, officials forecasted.\n\n34. Osama bin Laden is Assassinated (2011)\n\nFact Check\n\nSome Misinformation\n\nIn the previous decade, in the core of New York City, the World Trade Center was allegedly brought down by operatives of Al-Qaeda as part of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The mastermind, Osama bin Laden, was said to be behind those attacks and others, prompting the War on Terror and the signing of the Patriot Act by Jim Sensenbrenner, granting omissible surveillance capabilities to the National Security Agency for inhibiting acts of terrorism.\n\nFollowing a 10-year search, bin Laden, 54, was reportedly executed at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan by a team of United States Navy SEALs. The 44th U.S. President Barack Obama appeared on major television networks to address the nation just before midnight, stating: ΓÇ£To those families who have lost loved ones to al-QaedaΓÇÖs terror, justice has been done.ΓÇ¥\n\n33. New York Becomes Largest State To Allow Same-Sex Marriage (2011)\n\nFact Check\n\nAccurate Reporting\n\nIn mid-2011, a same-sex marriage bill was passed by the New York Senate in a 33 to 29 vote, recognizing its legality. The law, known as the Marriage Equality Act, prohibits local and state courts from penalizing religious institutions or employees.\n\nSigned by Democrat Andrew Cuomo, the 56th Governer of New York, the state became the sixth in the U.S. to permit same-sex marriages, paving the way for the passing of bills in other states as well.\n\n32. Whitey Bulger Is Apprehended (2011)\n\nFact Check\n\nAccurate Reporting\n\nJames Bulger, also known as Whitey Bulger, was an Irish-American organized crime boss whose criminality can be traced as far back as his time in the U.S. Air Force. After receiving an honorable discharge there, Bulger was sentenced to federal prison for armed robbery. In 1994, he fled Massachusetts amid a tip off from an FBI official of a pending RICO indictment.\n\nBulger was finally apprehended on June 22nd, 2011 and charged with numerous crimes, including racketeering, murder, and extortion. Since his capture, the life of Bulger has been depicted in numerous books, television series, and films.\n\n31.

Despite many such warnings from the WHO and other groups over many years, Australia remains woefully under-prepared for dealing with the health impacts of the climate crisis.\n\nIn the article below, Dr Chris Bourke, Strategic Programs Director at the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, identifies some key gaps in responses to the bushfire crisis to date, and some opportunities for progressing policy and service delivery on health-related climate impacts.\n\nChris Bourke writes:\n\nAustralians have been shocked by the severity of our latest bushfire season.\n\nMillions of hectares of bush have burned with thousands of homes destroyed and dozens of people killed.\n\nYet it should not have been a surprise that things could get this bad.\n\nScientists and rural fire authorities have been sounding alarm bells for years about the effects of climate change upon the vast eucalyptus forests that spread across the eastern Australian seaboard and beyond.\n\nRight now, in the middle of this current fire season there are more big-picture lessons than can be learned.\n\nFirst, the health effects of bushfires include the immediate emergency care required for burns and other trauma, the short and long-term effects of smoke inhalation, and mental ill-health.\n\nThese impacts all create greater demand for healthcare services.\n\nManaging this demand entails either increased resources in affected localities, triage, or evacuation.\n\nChaotic and piecemeal responses\n\nWe have just seen the largest peacetime mass evacuation in Australia when thousands of residents and holidaymakers fled the NSW south coast, Gippsland, and north-east Victoria.\n\nBut the images of people stranded on beaches for days awaiting rescue show us that evacuation is not something we do well.\n\nNot enough and too late.\n\nThis Australian experience can be compared with our Asian neighbours who regularly evacuate hundreds of thousands of people when faced with natural disasters.\n\nFor example, in Japan last year, more than 340,000 people were required to leave their homes in the Fukushima prefecture because of Typhoon Hagibis. Mass evacuation is also common in less affluent countries with the Philippines evacuating 750,000 in preparation for Typhoon Haiyan.\n\nPreparation for large scale evacuation seems to be seriously underdone in Australia.\n\nRecent stories illustrating our chaotic and piecemeal approach include motel owners in Batemans Bay providing free beds for refugees and callouts for help from AirBnB hosts.\n\nMuch greater preparedness for mass evacuation is needed that can be initiated earlier and with greater thoroughness.\n\nThis also will require community education of both the necessity and facilities available for their evacuation.\n\nOther priorities\n\nSecond, the long-term effects of inhaling bushfire smoke are unknown.\n\nWhile we know that people with pre-existing respiratory disease and vulnerable populations will suffer an immediate effect, the long-term population health outcomes have not been properly researched.\n\nThe new norm of months of smoke exposure, as endured by over 400,000 Canberrans where air quality sets new records for the worldΓÇÖs worst, requires study.\n\nCommonwealth investment in data development and linkage, as well as immediate funding for research, is required to inform an evidence base on respiratory illness and the longΓÇæterm effects of prolonged exposure to bushfire smoke.\n\nFurthermore, the forthcoming National Preventive Health Strategy should recognise the influence of the environment on health, engaging local and state governments, including urban and regional planning services, to ensure that the environments where we live, work, socialise and learn encourage and facilitate healthy lifestyles.\n\nThird, equity must be a hallmark of the Commonwealth response to the broader community impact of bushfires.\n\nFor example, rural fire service volunteers have been discriminated against for payments according to the size of their employer ΓÇô this is illogical and unfair.\n\nThe Commonwealth has not sought to engage with Aboriginal people who not only live in greater proportions within the affected areas but are also disproportionately impacted by natural disasters through the loss of cultural resources.\n\nSelf-help by Aboriginal organisations, such as the fantastic example of Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Service sending a semi-trailer of non-perishable food, bottled water, clothes and camping equipment to fire-affected communities on the South Coast, is not a substitute for the Commonwealth reaching out to co-design both the emergency and reconstruction effort with Aboriginal people and communities.\n\nWe know that the Commonwealth can do this, as evidenced by the highly lauded engagement between with peak Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to design the new Close the Gap strategy.\n\nWhy hasnΓÇÖt this lesson been applied to bushfire response and recovery?\n\nCoordinated response\n\nFourth, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments need to work in a coordinated manner with local fire and emergency services to ensure the most effective response to helping communities through these disasters.\n\nUnilateral action, while well intended, will not achieve this.\n\nOffers of assistance from well-meaning individuals and organisations can also be unhelpful in managing emergency responses with scarce resources.\n\nExperience from previous disaster situations is that trained volunteers are better equipped to respond than ΓÇÿspontaneousΓÇÖ volunteers.\n\nFor example, Australian Medical Assistance Teams (AUSMAT) are multi-disciplinary health teams incorporating doctors, nurses, paramedics, fire-fighters (logisticians) and allied health staff such as environmental health staff, radiographers and pharmacists. Their work is led through an integrated national emergency response plan, where these volunteers are trained to work within the national emergency response plan.\n\nThe new ΓÇÿnormalΓÇÖ of a five months long annual bushfire season requires system adaptation to meet the new challenges, as well as national and international leadership to act on climate change and the associated impacts on the health of our communities.\n\nOur vision at the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association is for a healthy Australia supported by the best possible healthcare system.\n\nBut this will not be achieved without big picture thinking and a strategic approach that addresses contemporary challenges such as climate-related health impacts.\n\nThe time for progressive and responsible coordinated change is now.\n\nΓÇó Dr Chris Bourke, Strategic Programs Director, Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association",

        "content" : "The death toll from Typhoon PhanfoneΓÇÖs battering of the Philippines on Christmas Day has risen to 28, and will likely climb further, authorities said on Friday.\n\nThe storm, with wind gusts of up to 200 kilometre (124 miles) per hour, swept across remote villages and popular tourist destinations in the central Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities on Friday confirmed 28 people had died, up from 16 on Thursday, as information came in from badly hit areas where internet and mobile phone networks had been cut.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of around 20 storms a year\n\nΓÇ£The likelihood is present that the casualty count will still increase. WeΓÇÖre hoping against it,ΓÇ¥ national disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal told AFP. He said at least 12 people were still listed as missing.\n\nAmong those killed were several members of a family who drowned, a policeman electrocuted by a toppled post while patrolling and a man struck by a felled coconut tree.\n\nWEATHER UPDATE: Typhoon #UrsulaPH ( #Phanfone) continues to linger west of Luzon (inside PAR) and has climbed in the same latitude with Zambales-Pangasinan provinces.\n\nThe tail-end of the cold front is affecting Northern Luzon.\n\n|satellite images from JMA-Himawari pic.twitter.com/a8W0Gpf1Ni\n\nΓÇö EarthShakerPH (@earthshakerph) December 27, 2019\n\nThe Philippines is a mostly Catholic nation, and Phanfone ruined or disrupted Christmas festivities for hundreds thousands of people.\n\nRead more: Typhoon Phanfone kills at least 16 in Philippines\n\nThe typhoon displaced tens of thousands living on the coast and low-lying areas who were forced to celebrate Christmas in evacuation centres.\n\n#Typhoon #Phanfone hit late on Tuesd. with winds of up to120 kph (75mph) and gusts of150 kph,dumping sheets of uninterrupted rain on a string of islands,damaging hundreds of homes and causing flooding in eight areas. It was the seventh typhoon to strike the Philippines this year https://t.co/XhLm48miNw\n\nΓÇö la Webdromadaire (@Caphi) December 27, 2019\n\nOthers missed family reunions, with plane and ferry services cancelled. It also hit Boracay island, famed for its white sand beaches which draws more than a million tourists a year.\n\nCoconut trees were uprooted on Boracay and windows in some resorts were blown in during the storm, and ferry services to and from the island were cut on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe storm, with wind gusts of up to 200 kilometre (124 miles) per hour, swept across remote villages and popular tourist destinations in the central Philippines\n\nHowever no one died on Boracay, and the damage was not on the scale of badly hit coastal towns elsewhere in the central Philippines.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of around 20 storms a year. Phanfone, locally named ΓÇ£UrsulaΓÇ¥, is the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2019.\n\nRead more: Urgent preparations as super typhoon closes in on Philippines\n\nMany of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.\n\nTyphoon leaves at least 16 dead in Philippines, SE Asia News & Top Stories ΓÇô https://t.co/7X9goWTmny#Asia #dead #Leaves #News #Philippines #SE #stories #top #Typhoon #News pic.twitter.com/HiN9ROCC3b\n\nΓÇö Flying Eze (@flyingeze) December 26, 2019\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇö the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nPhanfone blew out into the South China Sea on Thursday morning.

This was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded.\n\nThe UK government provided vital humanitarian relief, which included food, shelter, clean water, medicine and other supplies for up to 800,000 victims.\n\nThe UK Armed Forces were on the ground and in the air helping to deliver the life-saving aid to those worst affected by the Typhoon.\n\nThe response of the UK Armed Forces included destroyer HMS Daring and later helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious, while the RAF committed C17 and C130 transporters to bring in and distribute aid.\n\nA Royal Marine helping local villagers during disaster relief following Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. 2014\n\nOperation GRITROCK ΓÇö Sierra Leone Ebola outbreak \uD83C\uDDF8\uD83C\uDDF1\n\nIn 2014, the UK was first deployed to Sierra Leone to work with the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the wider international community to combat the unprecedented outbreak of Ebola, which claimed the lives of over 11,000 people in West Africa.\n\nAt this time, the deployment of military personnel to the region represented the largest UK military commitment anywhere in the world, with over 800 personnel assigned to the operation.\n\nA British Army Nurse in the Role 2 hospital where she works, at the UK Ebola Task Force HQ near Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Mounts Bay was quickly re-tasked in anticipation of Hurricane Dorian, the strongest ever recorded in The Bahamas.\n\nSaving lives in the Caribbean Personnel from RFA Mounts Bay, delivering aid to the community of Fox Town on the island of Little Abaco. 70 Years of the most successful Alliance \uD83D\uDCAA\n\n2019 marked the 70th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO is a military and political alliance of 29 countries across Europe and North America. The UK has been there from the very start.\n\nIt is often said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded in response to the threat posed by the Soviet Union. This is only partially true. In fact, the AllianceΓÇÖs creation was part of a broader effort to serve three purposes: deterring Soviet expansionism, forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in Europe through a strong North American presence on the continent, and encouraging European political integration.\n\n#WeAreNATO: But what does that actually mean?

        "title" : "\"Acts of God\"ΓÇöInterruptions Beyond Control | \"It's All About Discipleship, Genius!\"",
        "content" : "WHEN AN EXTRAORDINARY interruption by a natural cause happens, people would start to ask questions that has something to do with God allowing such a thing to occur. If he is such a good and just God, why would he let such a thing? One would hear the echo of this type of inquiry around meals or in coffee shops.\n\nA day before the Taal eruptions (Sunday, January 12, 2020), I heard a family conversation of a personΓÇÖs struggle in trying to comprehend why a good God would allow the bush fires in Australia. My concern towards the person increased all the more the next day when Taal erupted and covered Tagaytay and the nearby towns with ash fall. And around the dinner table that Sunday night with some of our dear pastors, it made me remember the general content of Dr. BroocksΓÇÖ email to me almost seven years prior.\n\nI had a similar experience when Janssen and I went to Tacloban in the aftermath of the super typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan. Nineteen days after that fateful day, we got the chance to see the situation up close. Around that dinner table, a well-to-do gentleman asks a question directed to us after we were introduced as pastors. He first gave a premise that he never shed a single tear when his father passed away. Only in Tacloban that he cried a bucket of tears as he has seen bodies of babies taken out of the rubbles every day.\n\nΓÇ£Pastor, if God is good, why would he allow these things to happen? DonΓÇÖt get me wrong; I am not an atheist. I can not comprehend such a God letting babies perish with their lives still ahead of them. I see bodies of babies every single day since I was here!ΓÇ¥\n\nAnswers started flying all over the place. I have never seen such highly opinionated individuals in one table! When it was my turn, I just asked his email address so I can send my answer to him since I will have a run the next day with the evacuees together with the running priest, Fr. Robert Reyes.\n\nBefore going to bed, more like a mat on the floor, I immediately send an SOS message to my friend, best-selling author ( GodΓÇÖs Not Dead, Man Myth Messiah, and the Human Right) Dr. Rice Broocks via Direct Message on Twitter.\n\n(10/27/13, 11:28 PM) Rice, I am currently in Tacloban. Yes, the worst hit by Haiyan/Yolanda. About to sleep approaching midnight here. I have a question over dinner: If God is such a just God, why were these innocent children die such a violent death? (Talking about kids who didnΓÇÖt survive Haiyan). What is your initial answer to this logical question? [My email: ____].\n\nRiceΓÇÖs response to my email came the very next day. And since the Taal eruption is still fresh in the minds of the people, I decided to revive my decade-old inactive website, so I can have a platform on which I could post RiceΓÇÖs response.\n\nHere is Rice BroocksΓÇÖ epistle to the running pastor:\n\nFerdie,\n\nI just got the DM [TwitterΓÇÖs direct message].\n\nThere is no easy answer to the impact of natural evil.\n\nHere are some thoughts:\n\n1) Just like the rain falls on the righteous and the unrighteous, so do the floods and other natural calamities. Believers and unbelievers are all affected.\n\n2) We live in a fragile world, yet the Universe at large is a vast dark, hostile place.\n\nThe fact that we have so few of these disasters is a miracle. We live on an island of life amid a dark, cold universe.\n\n3) Earthquakes, typhoons, and volcanoes serve a purpose. They help regulate the earthΓÇÖs temperature and make life on earth possible in many ways.\n\n4) At the same time, we have the capability as humans to anticipate such impending calamities and minimise and even avoid loss of life in many cases. We have come a long way in this area yet.\n\nWe are called to take dominion over the earth and given the ability to reason with God to accomplish this. (What if a man were like all the other animals? We wouldnΓÇÖt even be aware of what happened. We would be defenseless and response-less).\n\nJust as the islands and landmasses have appeared suddenly out of the water, they are, therefore, dangerous places to live.\n\nNo one would build a town at the base of an active volcano, yet we live in vulnerable places.\n\n5) None of that eases the pain when it comes to human suffering, especially involving children. It is the most vexing reality of all. However, there will be stories of miracles and divine intervention. God didnΓÇÖt stop the natural order from taking place, but He stepped in and helped many.\n\nGod acts during such calamities while not suspending the potential damage of such events.\n\n6) He stands ready to hear our cry for deliverance. Even before and during such disasters as well as comfort the survivors. Also. God personally cares for humanity through His people. The people who survive will experience a continual outpouring of love and grace. We can also be comforted in the thought that God instantly brings children into His presence in Heaven where there is no more fear, pain, or abuse. They are safe for eternity now.\n\n7) Without God, we have no hope against even greater calamities. GodΓÇÖs promises have kept our planet safe for billions of years, if not, we would have been taken out a long ago.\n\nImagine a white cue ball on a pool table where all the other balls are moving around, and the white ball never gets hit for 4 billion years!\n\nMay God grant us grace and wisdom to help and make a difference in peopleΓÇÖs lives.\n\nOn another note, Ged was a real help. We are hoping he can come back from Jan-May to finish the school year. We hope to know if heΓÇÖs returning ASAP. If not, we would love to consider someone else from the Philippines.\n\nPraise God that Manny won!\n\nI gave him Micah 7:8 a year ago. He has texted me twice since the fight.\n\nThank you for carrying the banner of the Evangelist. I would love to come back and do a national Evangelists conference.\n\nYou and I could co-host, and both speak and train them.\n\nThoughts?\n\nBlessings,\n\nRice\n\nTo folks who are having second thoughts about the goodness of God, may this serve as a resource, especially during times of extraordinary interruptionsΓÇöacts of God.\n\nSo as we discover GodΓÇÖs kindness, may we be able to experience the reality of itΓÇöall the time!",

        "title" : "Opinion: Typhoons at Christmas is the new reality",
        "content" : "Ever since Typhoon Haiyan (locally named as Yolanda) struck the provinces of Leyte and Samar six years ago, life in the central region of the Philippines has never been the same. My home city of Tacloban, ground zero of HaiyanΓÇÖs fury, experienced a tsunami-like surge in November 2013, killing more than 6,000 people, including some of my friends.\n\nSince that fateful day, strong typhoons have been battering the islands every year with increasing ferocity. It was not always like this. I remember as a child growing up in the region that typhoons came on average of about 20 per year, but they rarely became monster storms causing tremendous losses in lives and property. A typhoon happening in December is even a rare occurrence.\n\nAnd thatΓÇÖs exactly what happened on Christmas Eve. Instead of attending midnight mass, my family and friends spent the night huddled around candlelight, trying to weather yet another strong typhoon. Some loss of lives was reported, although not on the scale that Haiyan did when its record wind gusts caught everyone by surprise. This time, the people living in the coastal areas were ready and heeded the early evacuation advice.\n\nMany experts have noted that the warming planet is causing the formation of more monster storms in the Pacific Ocean. We are indeed living the consequences of global warming: intense storms in one place and drought and wildfires elsewhere in the world.\n\nI know that the people in that region of the Philippines are strong and resilient. They know how to bounce back from adversity. But the challenge these days is so overwhelming that they are almost living the curse of Sisyphus ΓÇö making a few strides forward only to be held back again by the onslaught of more powerful storms.\n\nI did notice a glimmer of hope while visiting friends and family there this Christmas. People tend to be more aware of whatΓÇÖs happening with the environment. A lot of restaurants, for example, no longer use plastic straws and are using paper straws ΓÇöthat is, if customers asked for one. Resorts are banning bottled water and offering tourists easy access to distilled or purified water. I also sensed knowledge among people that the use of plastic bags tends to end up in the ocean, damaging precious marine life.\n\nBut these are only little things, and thereΓÇÖs a whole lot more that needs to be done to make a dent in reducing greenhouse gasses. Since this is a global phenomenon, I do think that wealthy countries such as Canada and the U.S. should help poorer countries deal with the direct effects of climate change in the form of technical, financial and other kinds of assistance.\n\nThere are also some practical things that people in advanced countries can do to make a difference in the lives of others. For example, university students, especially future engineers, can learn from the experiences of the folks impacted by climate change and find ways to help design some new disaster-resilient dwellings. There has to be an affordable way for farmers and fisherfolks who rely on their livelihood on the land and the ocean to build stronger homes using local materials.\n\nThe new climate reality in the Philippines and elsewhere around the world also offers a lot of opportunities for first responders to learn how to deal with a new level of challenges brought by more powerful storms. For the typhoon that happened on Christmas Eve, I was surprised how quick the authorities were in deploying digital media tools to reach millions of people. They were also able to restore power and communications after a couple of days.\n\nWe can certainly do more to help mitigate the effects of climate change. To those who live in relatively wealthy countries, the people and governments certainly have a duty to uphold and promote the fundamental human right of every person and family impacted by climate change: the right to earn a livelihood and the right to live in peace and in harmony with Mother Nature.\n\nRey Rosales is a journalism professor and chair of the department of communication at MacEwan University.",

I used to save lives for minimal pay, now I make 4 times what I did. But have no drive and want to end it all most of the days I am here. I need help and advice. Is there any veteran who feels the same? I got prescribed pain pills from an in flight accident in my air force career where I damaged my shoulder and back during a combat airdrop. I was always against drugs but now abuse them to feel normal again and calm my thoughts down. I've helped with typhoon haiyan in the phillipines and got credited with saving 233 lives but saw thousands of dead bodies and still cannot stop seeing them in dreams constantly.

        "content" : "MANILA, Philippines (AP) ΓÇö A typhoon that barreled through the central Philippines left at least 28 dead and 12 missing and forced thousands to flee their homes, devastating Christmas celebrations in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone stranded people at sea and airports at the peak of holiday travel, set off landslides, flooded low-lying villages, destroyed houses, downed trees and electrical poles and knocked out power in entire provinces. One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ghost town on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 74 mph and gusts of 93 mph, after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the deaths reported by police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve, then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in seaports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster-prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

        "content" : "Current Affairs Of Today Are\n\n1) Locust invasion in Gujarat\n\nGujarat is under attack from hopper's newborn locusts that have flown across the international border. As the swarms mature, they have ravaged farms in north Gujarat, devastating farms in the three border districts Banaskantha, Patan, and Kutch. The locusts, known as tiddis locally, have wreaked havoc on standing crops including castor, cumin, jatropha and cotton, and fodder grass in around 20 talukas Gujarat has not witnessed such an invasion of locusts since 1993-94. The State administration has been caught napping despite an alert from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of a massive locust attack in South Asia, covering Pakistan and India. The Locust Warning Organization (LWO) in Jodhpur had noticed the swarms and predicted their trajectory across the international border. However, preventive measures by the authorities were not taken. The border districts, Banaskantha is the worst affected. The insects fly in during the day and settle on the farms at night, making it difficult to ward them off.   Steps were taken for the prevention of crops\n\nLOCUST OR TIDDIES   The farmers under siege are hiring workers and using age-old techniques like beating drums and vessels to scare the locusts away without much success Rather late in the day, the authorities have stepped in to combat the voracious invasion. The State administration along with the central teams has launched huge pesticidespraying operation to kill the insects\n\nOrigin of Locust\n\nAccording to the Agriculture MinistryΓÇÖs Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), locusts are flying in from PakistanΓÇÖs Sindh province and spreading in villages in Rajasthan and Gujarat where southwestern monsoon was prolonged this year. Originally, the locusts emerged in February this year from Sudan and Eritrea on AfricaΓÇÖs Red Sea Coast and traveled through Saudi Arabia and Iran to enter Pakistan, where they invaded the Sindh province and from there they moved into Rajasthan and Gujarat.   Government taking steps to curb damages\n\nThe government has now assured farmers that the administration will carry out a survey to assess the damages and will accordingly compensate farmers. However, farmers feel that the governmentΓÇÖs efforts are too little, too late.\n\n2) History of the Growing burden of Cancer in India: From Antiquity to the 21st century.\n\nA study tracing the growing burden of cancer in India states that most of the increase in cancer incidences are attributable to its epidemiological transition and improvement in the use of cancer diagnostics. The country's cancer burden will continue to increase as a result of the ongoing aging of India and improving access to cancer diagnostics in rural India The paper was published in the Journal of Global Oncology which is promoted by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The study has stated that while cancerlike diseases were documented since antiquity, recording of cancer in India began in the 19th century when the Western practices of biopsy and pathological examination came to India during the colonial British regime. Cancer is primarily a disease of older people, hence, as life expectancy went up, cancer incidences too went up Maximum increases will occur in the most populous and least developed States, where the facilities for cancer diagnostics and treatment are inadequate The study offers lessons for planning cancer care in States as well as other countries experiencing epidemiological transition. In India, the fastest epidemiological transition happened in Kerala, whereas Uttar Pradesh remained in the slowest group\n\nType of Cancer\n\nA direct comparison of the demographic and social variables, available health care facilities and leading causes of mortality in these two States shows how the low incidences of infectious diseases in Kerala have given rise to more cancer compared to U.P., which is still battling high mortality from communicable diseases The types of cancers in India are also undergoing a transition, similar to a report from Japan five decades ago. There has been a decline of cancers caused by infections, such as cervical, stomach, and penile cancer, and an increase in cancers associated with energy intake, physical activity imbalance, and aging, such as breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Cancer transitions can influence the requirements for sitespecialized cancer surgeons, the study says. For example, Kerala will need more breast oncologists and U.P. will need more gynecological oncologists\n\nEvidence of cancer in Indus Valley sites\n\nEvidence of cancer in early humans were found in a review of 154 paleopathological studies dating back to 1.8 million years in historic Egyptian and German sites. No paleooncology reports of cancer have been recorded at the Indus Valley civilization or Deccan Chalcolithic sites except for the mention of some benign osteomas. Fewer samples and poor preservation were some of the limitations of these studies The study says, there are references to cancerlike symptoms in many ancient texts including the ΓÇÿAtharva VedaΓÇÖ and two ancient medical systems, Ayurveda and Siddha, which have been in use for more than 2,500 years. These texts mention the use of surgery and herbal medications for these diseases. The ancient medical classics of India have devoted little attention to cancerlike illnesses, suggesting a low prevalence of cancer in those times perhaps\n\n3) ΓÇÿGood Governance IndexΓÇÖ launched by MoS (PP) Dr. Jitendra Singh on ΓÇÿGood Governance DayΓÇÖ\n\nThe MoS (PP) Dr. Jitendra Singh launched the ΓÇÿGood Governance IndexΓÇÖ at an event organized by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, on the occasion of Good Governance Day\n\nThe Good Governance Day is observed on the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nGood Governance Index has been scientifically designed on various parameters of governance.\n\nAbout Good Governance Index\n\nThe Good Governance Index is a uniform tool across the States to assess the Status of Governance and the impact of various interventions taken up by the State Government and UTs.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe objectives of GGI are to provide quantifiable data to compare the state of governance in all states and UTs, enable states and UTs to formulate and implement suitable strategies for improving governance and shift to result-oriented approaches and administration. Various principles have been kept in mind while selecting the indicators, i.e. it should be easy to understand & calculate, citizen-centric & result-driven, leading to improved results and applicable to all states and UTs, among others. Various consultation meetings were held with the stakeholders, including consultations with sector experts, ministries, states & UTs.\n\nThe GGI takes into consideration ten sectors\n\n1). Agriculture and Allied Sectors, 2). Commerce & Industries, 3). Human Resource Development, 4). Public Health, 5). Public Infrastructure & Utilities, 6). Economic Governance, 7). Social Welfare & Development, 8). Judicial & Public Security, 9). Environment and 10). Citizen-Centric Governance. These ten Governance Sectors are measured on a total of 50 indicators. Difference indicators are given different weights under one Governance Sector to calculate the value. E.g. Under Agriculture & Allied Sector, there are 6 indicators with different weight, namely: Growth rate of agriculture and allied sector (0.4), growth rate of food grains production (0.1), growth rate of horticulture produce (0.1), growth rate of milk production (0.1), growth rate of meat production (0.1) and crop insurance (0.2). The states and UTs are divided into three groups: a). The Big States, b). North-East & Hill States and c). UTs. The states and UTs are ranked on all indicators separately, at the same time composite ranking is also calculated for these states and UTs under their respective groups based upon these indicators.   The Minister also launched the 15th edition of Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure (CSMOP)\n\nAbout CSMOP\n\nThe 1st CSMOP was published in 1955 and has been updated from time to time. The last edition (14th edition) was published in 2015. To meet the requirements of the digital environment, DARPG (Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances) has brought out the 15th edition of CSMOP which integrates conventional office practices with e-office. Presently, more than 90% of ministries have adopted e-office and 14,56,739 files are running in about 84 Ministries/Departments through e-office. In total. 57 ministries/departments have achieved the desired target of 80% and above in e-office. The draft CSMOP was circulated to all ministries/departments and their views were incorporated in it\n\nThe main features of the CSMOP, which enables the march towards the digital Secretariat, are as follows:\n\nA new chapter on e-Office digitization framework that provides guidelines for scanning, entry and storage of data, provision of Virtual Private Network for officers of the rank of DS and above following scrutiny safeguards, provision for DSC to dealing officers and above rank officers, knowledge management provides the details regarding maintenance of Standing Guard Files, Standing Note, Induction Material etc, which helps in smooth disposal of work and decision making chapter provides a list of various website and their links   4) Typhoon Phanfone\n\nTyphoon Phanfone pummelled the central Philippines on Christmas Day, bringing a wet, miserable and terrifying holiday to millions in the mainly Catholic nation. The typhoon leaped from one small island to another for the second day crumpling houses, toppling trees and blacking out cities and towns Though weaker, Phanfone was tracking a similar path to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the countryΓÇÖs deadliest cyclone on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013. More than 16,000 people spent the night in improvised shelters in schools, gyms and government buildings as the typhoon first made landfall More than 25,000 people remained stranded at ports on Christmas Day with ferry services still shut down Scores of flights to the region also remained canceled, though the populous capital Manila has so far been spared.\n\n5) Free WiFi to villages\n\nTelecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad promised free WiFi to about 48,000 villages, which are connected through the governmentΓÇÖs flagship Bharatnet project, for the next three months. To promote uptake of the Internet in rural areas With the BharatNet initiative, the Centre aims to connect all 2.5 lakh gram panchayats through an optical fiber. Till now, about 48,000 villages have been connected to WiFi using BharatNet. The government is aiming to convert at least 15% of the total villages to the digital village in the next 3-4 years.\n\nDigital Village\n\nDigital Village, which was conceptualized by the Common Service Centre (CSC) SPV under the Ministry of Electronics and IT, is a village where citizens can avail of various eservices of the central and the State governments, as well as of private players. These include banking, insurance, telemedicine, pension, and egovernance services. Such villages are also equipped with an LED bulb assembly unit, sanitary napkin unit, and rural-Wifi infrastructure. Initially, the scheme was unveiled at five locations as a pilot. ΓÇ£Considering the success of the pilot, CSC SPV has been given the task of setting up 700 Digital Villages across the country, one in every district.ΓÇ¥   6) NITI Aayog bats for 2 GST slabs\n\nGovernment thinktank NITI Aayog Member Ramesh Chand made a case for only two slabs under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime as against the current multiple slabs, and said rates should be revised annually if required. Currently, there are four GST rate slabs 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. Several items fall in the exempt or nil duty category. Besides, cess is also levied on five goods. The GST, which replaced almost all the indirect taxes, came into force on July 1, 2017, and the tax rates have been revised several times since then. When a large taxation reform such as GST is brought in, there are always ΓÇÿteething problemsΓÇÖ but soon they stabilize. Most of the countries took a long time for GST stabilization. It has become a tendency of every sector to ask for lower GST. I feel GST issues are much larger than asking for rates we should not fiddle with rates or change rates frequently... We should not have many rates. Have only two rates The focus should be on a steady increase in revenue collection from the new indirect tax regime rather than tinkering with rates. He prescribed that if at all rates needed to be changed, it should be done annually. On demands for lower GST on processed food such as dairy products, an agri-economist, said the 5% GST on such products was ΓÇ£very, very reasonable.ΓÇ¥ While every sector was demanding a lower rate, they should also understand governments need revenue to spend on development works. The agriculture sector alone, the Central government was providing a subsidy of Γé╣1.2 lakh crore and the States, put together, spend about Γé╣1 lakh crore.\n\n7) 10 GW solar capacity\n\nState-owned power giant NTPC is planning to add 10 GW of solar energy generation capacity by 2022, which entails an investment of around Γé╣50,000 crores, to be funded mainly by green bonds NTPC has installed renewable energy capacity of 920 MW, which constitutes mainly solar energy. It has formulated a longterm plan to become a 130 GW company by 2032 with 30% nonfossil fuel or renewable energy capacity. The company will complete tendering of 2,300 MW of solar energy capacity by the end of this fiscal. Thereafter, it has planned to add 4 GW each in 2020-21 and 2021-22 The power major would also set up some of its solar energy projects under a scheme where it gets viability gap funding to keep the tariff below the Γé╣3perunit level. The company will also set up solar energy projects without longterm (25 years) power purchase agreements as it aims to sell the electricity to industrial as well as commercial consumers and also at energy exchanges The Central Electricity Regulatory Authority has already approved the realtime power market, which is expected to kick in by April 1, 2020. There would be 48 sessions of half an hour each in a day, to allow consumers to get the desired power supply within an hour of buying at the exchanges. Power is now traded for two hours in a day from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m., where a consumer can schedule the delivery a day in advance.",

        "content" : "A typhoon that swept across remote villages and popular tourist areas of the central Philippines on Christmas Day claimed at least 16 lives, authorities said Thursday.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone, with winds of 195 kilometers, or 120 miles, an hour, tore roofs off houses and toppled electric posts as it cut across the Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nWith the internet and mobile phone networks still cut off in some badly damaged areas, a full assessment of PhanfoneΓÇÖs damage was not immediately possible on Thursday morning.\n\nBut at least 16 people had been confirmed killed in villages and towns in the Visayas, the central third of the Philippines, according to disaster agency officials.\n\nPhanfone also hit Boracay, Coron and other holiday destinations that are famed for their white-sand beaches and popular with foreign tourists.\n\nThe airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, according to a Korean tourist who was stranded there and provided images.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung Joon said via Instagram messenger.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within 100 meters of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been canceled.\n\nΓÇ£Taxis are still running but itΓÇÖs windy and still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, including me. ΓÇ¥\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇô the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like the younger sibling of Haiyan. ItΓÇÖs less destructive, but it followed a similar path,ΓÇ¥ said Cindy Ferrer, an information officer at the Western Visayas regionΓÇÖs disaster officer.\n\nTens of thousands of people in the mostly Catholic nation had been forced to evacuate their homes on Wednesday, ruining Christmas celebrations.\n\nMany others were not able to return to their families, with ferries and plane services suspended.\n\nAmong those killed by Phanfone was a police officer who was electrocuted by a toppled electric post while patrolling.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of about 20 major storms a year.\n\nMany of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.",

The stormΓÇÖs 120 mph winds blew across the islands of Leyte and Samar for 24 hours, peeling apart roofs and homes, felling power lines and flattening crops, while waves and storm surge wrecked fishing boats. This same region was devastated in 2013 by Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), and the area was still recovering from the lingering effects of that storm. Since the 2013 storm, ReachGlobal Crisis Response has been partnering with the Evangelical Free Church of the Philippines (EFCP) in long-term recovery and church planting efforts ( video update).\n\nBut on Christmas, many families that lost homes in 2013 again found themselves exposed.

But in Hernani alone, many houses are partially damaged, around 50 totally destroyed; 50% of fishing boats were destroyed; All bananas are down; and itΓÇÖll take a year for coconuts to recover. A portion of the roof of our ministry center is gone, our water tank fell down and back fence destroyed. Electricity and communication still down.

The stormΓÇÖs damage to homes, and livelihoods from loss of the fishing boats, and banana and coconut crops will be a big economic setback for the area.

        "title" : "Pope prays for victims of Christmas Day typhoon in Philippines",
        "content" : "After reciting the St StephenΓÇÖs Day Angelus on December 26, Pope Francis appealed for the people of the Philippines, victims of Christmas Day Typhoon Phanfone which killed at least 16 people. ΓÇ£I join in the suffering that has struck the dear people of the Philippines due to Typhoon Phanfone,ΓÇ¥ said the pope. Before inviting the faithful gathered in St PeterΓÇÖs Square to recite the Hail Mary, he assured them of his own prayers, ΓÇ£for the numerous victims, for the wounded, and for their families.ΓÇ¥ Typhoon Phanfone struck central Philippines on Christmas Day. The number of people missing is still unsure; around 60,000 have been evacuated. Phanfone struck close to regions hit by Typhoon Haiyan (known also as Super Typhoon Yolanda) in 2013, the most powerful storm ever to make landfall. More than 6,000 people were killed in November that year, making it the Philippines' deadliest typhoon. He took our sorrows During Francis' visit to the Philippines in 2015, he visited Tacloban, which was severely affected by Typhoon Haiyan. His visit had to be cut short because of adverse weather on the island and concerns about him being able to fly out. However, at the Mass he celebrated there, he left aside his prepared text for the homily and gave an emotional reflection on the Passion of Christ and human suffering: Jesus goes before us always; when we experience any kind of cross, he was already there before us. If today all of us are gathered here, fourteen months after the passage of Typhoon Yolanda, it is because we are certain that we will not be disappointed in our faith, for Jesus has gone before us. In his passion he took upon himself all of our sorrows, andΓÇª Let me tell you something personal ΓÇô when I witnessed his disaster from Rome, I felt that I had to be here. That is when I decided to come here. I wanted to come to be with you. Maybe you will tell me that I came a little late; that is true, but here I am! I am here to tell you that Jesus is Lord; that Jesus does not disappoint. ΓÇ£FatherΓÇ¥, one of you may tell me, ΓÇ£he disappointed me because I lost my house, I lost my family, I lost everything I had, I am sickΓÇ¥. What you say is true and I respect your feelings, but I see him there, nailed to the cross, and from there he does not disappoint us. He was consecrated Lord on that throne, and there he experienced all the disasters we experience. Jesus is Lord! And he is Lord from the cross, from there he reigned. That is why, as we heard in the first reading, he can understand us: he became like us in every way. So we have a Lord who is able to weep with us, who can be at our side through lifeΓÇÖs most difficult moments. So many of you have lost everything. I do not know what to tell you. But surely he knows what to tell you! So many of you have lost members of your family. I can only be silent; I accompany you silently, with my heartΓÇª Many of you looked to Christ and asked: Why, Lord? To each of you the Lord responds from his heart. I have no other words to say to you. Let us look to Christ: he is the Lord, and he understands us, for he experienced all the troubles we experience. With him, beneath the cross, is his Mother. We are like that child who stands down there, who, in times of sorrow and pain, times when we understand nothing, times when we want to rebel, can only reach out and cling to her skirts and say to her: ΓÇ£Mother!ΓÇ¥ Like a little child who is frightened and says: ΓÇ£MotherΓÇ¥. Perhaps that is the only word which can express all the feelings we have in those dark moments: Mother! Let us be still for a moment and look to the Lord. He can understand us, for he experienced all these things. And let us look to our Mother, and like that little child, let us reach out, cling to her skirts and say to her in our hearts: ΓÇ£MotherΓÇ¥. Let us make this prayer in silence; let everyone say it whatever way he or she feelsΓÇª",

        "title" : "Typhoon in Philippines leaves 20 dead",
        "content" : "MANILA, Philippines ΓÇö A strong typhoon that barreled through the central Philippines left at least 20 people dead and forced thousands to flee their homes, devastating Christmas celebrations in the predominantly Catholic country.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone stranded many people in sea and airports at the peak of holiday travel, set off landslides, flooded low-lying villages, destroyed houses, downed trees and electrical poles and knocked out power in entire provinces. One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly on Thursday as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph) after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the 20 deaths reported by national police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty, officials said.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power, government forecasters said.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

More than 6,000 people died and 200,000 homes destroyed when Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest-ever storm to make landfall in the Philippines, hit the central islands of Leyte and Samar six years ago.

The glass windows shattered and we took cover by the stairs,ΓÇ¥ Ailyn Metran told AFP after she and her 4-year-old child spent the night at the local state weather service office where her husband worked.\n\nA metal window frame flew off and fell onto a car parked outside the building, she said.\n\nWith just two hoursΓÇÖ sleep, the family returned to their home in the central city of Tacloban early Wednesday to find their two dogs safe, but the floor was covered in mud and a felled tree rested atop a nearby house.\n\nThe weather office said the typhoon strengthened slightly overnight Tuesday and was gusting at 195 kilometers an hour (121 mph), velocities that can knock down small trees and destroy houses made of light materials.\n\nMore islands are along its projected path are expected to be hit with destructive winds and intense rainfall before blowing out into the South China Sea early Thursday, it added.\n\nMore than 25,000 people trying to get home for the traditional Christmas Eve midnight dinner with their families remained stranded at ports on Christmas Day with ferry services still shut down, the coast guard said.\n\nScores of flights to the region also remained canceled, though the populous capital Manila, on the northern edge has so far been spared.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific cyclone belt.\n\nAs such, the archipelago gets hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, killing scores of people and wiping out harvests, homes and other infrastructure and keeping millions perennially poor.\n\nA July 2019 study by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank said the most frequent storms lop 1 percent off the Philippine economic output, with the stronger ones cutting output by nearly 3 percent.\n\nLATEST ASIA PACIFIC STORIES",

        "content" : "BEIJING Marco Storari Jersey , Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The China National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC) on Friday issued a yellow warning for very high seas and monster waves that are likely to be generated by super typhoon Haiyan in the next 24 hours. Haiyan, the 30th and strongest typhoon to hit China this year Manuel Locatelli Jersey , is expected to enter the South China Sea in two days, said the center. From noon on Friday to noon on Saturday M'Baye Niang Jersey , 5 to 8.5-meter waves will appear in the eastern part of the South China Sea, while 3 to 4-meter waves will hit the northern part of the South China Sea Lucas Ocampos Jersey , the center added. The NMEFC said 8 to 10-meter waves will appear near the center of the typhoon, making the South China Sea situation severe for shipping. The center asked ships there to return to port in time to avoid the typhoon and waves Lucas Biglia Jersey , and said related departments in coastal areas should take precautionary measures in advance. Yellow is the second tier in China's four-tier color-coded weather warning system. Related: \" By Michael Place RIO DE JANEIRO∩╝î March 29 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua looks at key takeaways from the latest round of South American zone (CONMEBOL) World Cup qualifiers. BRAZIL ARE BACK Brazil became the first team to secure a berth at next year's World Cup in Russia (other than the hosts) by defeating Uruguay 4-1 and Paraguay 3-0 in the past week. In the process∩╝î they racked up their eighth consecutive win under coach Tite∩╝î who replaced Dunga in June after the team's group-stage elimination from the Copa America. It's not only a return to Brazil's old air of invincibility that is making people take notice. The Selecao are playing with a flair that some are comparing to the 1970 and 1982 World Cup teams that captivated the world. Under Tite∩╝î Brazil have scored 24 goals - an average of three per match - and conceded just two. The third goal in their victory over Paraguay in Sao Paulo hearkened back to Brazil's glory days∩╝î featuring a delightful exchange between Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho before Marcelo nonchalantly chipped the ball over Paraguayan goalkeeper Antony Silva. CRUNCH TIME FOR ARGENTINA Argentina had not beaten Bolivia away from home since 2005 and their troubles in the dizzying heights of La Paz continued on Tuesday with a 2-0 defeat to Mauricio Soria's team. The Albiceleste were without five-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi∩╝î who was handed a four-match ban for verbally abusing an assistant referee just hours earlier. The result left Argentina outside CONMEBOL's automatic qualification places and put them in danger of missing their first World Cup since 1970. It also exposed the team's dependence on Messi∩╝î and that is why Argentina officials will likely do all they can to reduce the 29-year-old's penalty via the FIFA appeals process. COLOMBIA ARE THE REAL DEAL Questions were asked about Colombia's credentials after an unconvincing 1-0 home win over Bolivia last Thursday∩╝î a result that followed a 3-0 loss to Argentina and home draws against Chile and Uruguay. But Jose Pekerman's side put all doubt aside on Tuesday with a 2-0 away victory over Ecuador. Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez continued his rich vein of goalscoring form with his fifth goal of the campaign∩╝î while Juventus winger Juan Cuadrado was also on the scoresheet in Quito. Victories in their remaining two home matches should be enough to secure the Cafeteros a place at their second consecutive World Cup. ECUADOR ARE IN FREEFALL Ecuador set the CONMEBOL tournament ablaze early∩╝î leading the standings after victories in each of their first four matches. Since then the team has managed just two wins∩╝î two draws and six losses∩╝î and they are now in a battle just to earn a playoff spot. The loss of form has led to growing calls for coach Gustavo Quinteros to be sacked. Ecuadorian Football Federation (FEF) president Carlos Villacis refused to back the beleaguered manager during a press conference on Wednesday∩╝î saying a decision would be made on his future next Monday following a meeting of FEF directors. With or without the Argentina-born Quinteros∩╝î Ecuador will need more from their underperforming players if they are to qualify for their fourth World Cup∩╝î particularly Manchester United winger Antonio Valencia and Everton forward Enner Valencia. ARCE NOT MAKING FRIENDS Paraguay coach Francisco Arce had some strident words for his Brazil counterpart Tite after the pair clashed several times on the Corinthians Arena touchline. \"\"He is a little uptight∩╝î\"\" Arce told a news conference after the match. \"\"He shouted at me for no reason∩╝î telling me to stop my players tackling from behind. At no point were we doing that. It's not the way we play.\"\" Tite was not the only person rubbed the wrong way by Arce on Wednesday. Dario Lezcano∩╝î Paraguay's top scorer during the qualifiers with four goals∩╝î quit the national team after he was left out of the matchday squad. \"\"I would have been ok with being on the bench but I never expected to be left out. I have never been treated like that∩╝î\"\" Lezcano told reporters. \" Fitness Pointers To Help You Will Get In The Most Effective Form Of Your Life Fitness is important for all.

        "content" : "Predicting the damage caused by a hurricane might be possible thanks to an analysis of semantic web resources, according to work published in the International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering.\n\nQuang-Khai Tran and Sa-kwang Song of the Department of Big Data Science at the University of Science and Technology in South Korea, explain that they have created an algorithm trained with reported damage from 48 sites in the USA hit by five different hurricanes. The algorithm can then show the damage that would be seen six hours after landfall of other hurricanes based on the statistics. It works well even with sparse and incomplete data sets, the team reports, which could be important in the face of climate change and very variable weather reporting.\n\nΓÇ£[The system] was able to estimate the damage levels in several scenarios even if two-thirds of the relevant weather information was unavailable,ΓÇ¥ the team writes. Of course, additional information and training can only improve the system.\n\nIn the current version of the algorithm, the team explains that their statistical components should ultimately be able to cope with real-time streaming data with some additional development of a kind outlined in the paper. The system might then be able to predict damage should we once more see hurricanes of the scale and devastation of Katrina in the USA in 2005, cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008, and super typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013.\n\nTran, Q-K. and Song, S-k.

        "content" : "Storm-hit provinces still without power\n\nInternational\n\nDec 27. 2019\n\nPhilippine Daily Inquirer/Asia News Network\n\nTyphoon ΓÇ£UrsulaΓÇ¥ (international name: Phanfone) slightly weakened on Thursday as it moved away from land after wreaking havoc across the central Philippines on Christmas Day, killing 24 people.\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Thursday, Ursula was out in the West Philippine Sea, 300 kilometers northwest of Coron, Palawan, or 295 km west-southwest of Subic, Zambales, moving toward Vietnam at 15 km per hour with winds of up 120 kph and gusts of up to 150 kph, weaker than winds of up to 140 kph and gusts of up to 195 on Christmas Day.\n\nThe weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) expected the typhoon to exit Philippine territory by Saturday morning.\n\nCyclone warnings lifted\n\nAll cyclone warnings were lifted on Thursday. But Pagasa said sea travel remained risky, keeping ports in the typhoonΓÇÖs path shuttered.\n\nThousands of people remained in evacuation centers, where they celebrated Christmas as Ursula tore roofs off houses, toppled trees and electric posts, and caused flooding in remote villages as it swept across central Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nThough much weaker, Ursula tracked a similar path as Supertyphoon ΓÇ£YolandaΓÇ¥ (international name: Haiyan), the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like the younger sibling of Yolanda. ItΓÇÖs less destructive, but it followed a similar path,ΓÇ¥ said Cindy Ferrer, information officer at the Western Visayas disaster office.\n\nWith the internet and cellphone networks still cut off in some badly hit areas, a full assessment of storm damage was not immediately possible on Thursday.\n\nBut at least 20 people had been confirmed killed in villages and towns in central Visayas, disaster officials said.\n\nMost of the deaths reported by officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nThe fatalities included three in Leyte and Southern Leyte, four in Capiz and nine in Iloilo. Among the dead were a 13-year-old boy who was electrocuted, a man killed by a flying tree branch and another killed in a car accident.\n\nMore missing\n\nSix people were reported missing in Western Visayas. Reports of more fatalities and missing were still being verified on Thursday as government agencies conducted an assessment of damage in worst-hit areas in northern Panay Island.\n\nFour fishermen were reported missing in Borongan City, Eastern Samar province, according to city information officer Cynthia Arceno.\n\nUrsula hit land in Salcedo town, Eastern Samar, late on Tuesday and made six more landfalls as it blew west across central Philippines.\n\nMore than 58,000 people were evacuated from their homes before the storm, and they had ΓÇ£noche buena,ΓÇ¥ the traditional midnight repast to celebrate Christmas, at the evacuation centers.\n\nIn the Bicol Region, more than 9,000 people remained in evacuation centers in Masbate and Albay provinces on Thursday, according to civil defense officials.\n\nMore than 15,000 people failed to make it home for Christmas, as they were stranded at shuttered ports after the Coast Guard suspended shipping to avoid maritime accidents.\n\nStranded in Boracay\n\nDomestic airlines canceled scores of flights, including services to the airport in Kalibo, Aklan province, which the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines reported on Thursday as ΓÇ£heavily damaged.ΓÇ¥\n\nThe damage to the Kalibo airport stranded tourists on the world-famous Boracay Island, where ferry services were still not working on Thursday even though the typhoon had passed, according to police in Malay, the northernmost town in Panay. Boracay is part of the town.\n\nUrsulaΓÇÖs monster winds leveled houses in Oriental Mindoro province, where a tornado was also reported, and blew the roof off a public market in Occidental Mindoro. In Romblon, the towns of Santa Fe and San Jose remained without communication lines on Thursday. Santa Fe is on the southern tip of Tablas Island, while San Jose is on Carabao Island, which is near Boracay.\n\nNational Grid Corp. of the Philippines said restoration efforts continued on Thursday to bring back its downed transmission lines to service.\n\nKnocked out by the storm was the grid operatorΓÇÖs 69-kilovolt transmission line, which delivers power to electric cooperatives in Capiz, Aklan, Eastern Samar, Leyte and Biliran.\n\nAlso downed by Ursula was the companyΓÇÖs 138-kV line, cutting electricity to the entire province of Aklan.\n\nΓÇ£Inspection and restoration of lines in the affected areas will be in full swing as soon as the weather allows,ΓÇ¥ the grid operator said on Thursday.

        "content" : "By Nonoy Espina and Mark Navales\n\nThe death toll left by Typhoon Phanfone, which sliced through the central Philippines on Christmas Day, has reached 28 and may still climb, officials said Friday.\n\nDisaster officials said that of the total figure thus far, four were recorded in the province of Capiz; two in Aklan province; 13 in Iloilo; one in Southern Leyte; one in Cebu; two in Leyte; one in Biliran; three in Eastern Samar; and one in Western Samar.\n\nMark Cashean Timbal, spokesman for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, said that most of the deaths were due to drowning, electrocution or trauma from fallen debris. Twelve more people were reported missing while 45,000 families were displaced and staying in evacuation centers, he said.\n\nΓÇ£There are ongoing rescue operations for those residents trapped in their homes due to flooding. We have deployed our damage assessors to find out the extent of destruction,ΓÇ¥ Timbal said.\n\nPacking maximum sustained winds of 195 kph (120 mph), the typhoon, locally known as Ursula, made multiple landfalls after hitting Salcedo town in Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve, according to the state weather agency.\n\nIt also slammed into Tacloban City in Leyte province where Super Typhoon Haiyan, locally known as Yolanda, landed with devastating fury in 2013, leaving over 6,000 people dead.\n\nA number of domestic flights were cancelled while hundreds of passengers at the port in Manila were stranded after ferry services were suspended.\n\nGlobal humanitarian agency Oxfam said thousands of families in coastal areas affected by the typhoon urgently need food, water and shelter.\n\nΓÇ£Oxfam is deeply concerned about the situation of communities hit by Typhoon Ursula, which made seven landfalls in 24 hours beginning on Christmas Eve ΓÇô usually a time for celebration and thanksgiving in the Philippines. Many of the communities are still struggling to get back on their feet in the wake of Typhoon Kammuri, which hit earlier this month,ΓÇ¥ said country director Lot Felizco.\n\nFelizco said that in Leyte, Ursula carved the same path as Haiyan in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£Although weaker, its devastating impacts are widely felt, especially here in Leyte, where houses have been damaged and electric posts toppled. We spent Christmas Day in total darkness,ΓÇ¥ Felizco said.\n\nArthur Defensor Jr., the governor of Iloilo province, said they were still verifying additional reports of missing persons and other deaths.\n\nΓÇ£There are still three missing people from three of my towns, but we are still validating the report,ΓÇ¥ Defensor said.\n\nAbout 20 tropical storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, some of them devastating. Earlier in December, Typhoon Kammuri caused widespread damage and left at least 13 people dead.\n\nPlease Donate Today\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph), after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the deaths reported by police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

        "content" : "MANILA: A strong typhoon that barreled through the central Philippines left at least 28 dead and 12 missing, and forced thousands to flee their homes, devastating Christmas celebrations in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. Typhoon Phanfone stranded many people in sea and airports at the peak of holiday travel, set off landslides, flooded low-lying villages, destroyed houses, downed trees and electrical poles and knocked out power in entire provinces.\n\nOne disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day. ΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone. The storm weakened as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour and gusts of 150 kph, after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the deaths reported by police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty. The typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals. More than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were cancelled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇÿRing of FireΓÇÖ, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, travelled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.

It reached winds of 200kmph (125 miles per hour), leaving thousands stranded as they tried to make their way home for Christmas.\n\nWestern parts of Visayas, the central of the three main island groups that make up the Philippines, were among the worst affected. In lloilo province, at least 13 people died.\n\nAccording to news site Rappler, six people from the same family were killed while visiting the town of Batad for a family funeral.\n\nImage copyrightGetty Images\n\nImage caption\n\nThe province of Iloilo was among the worst hit  The popular tourist island of Boracay was also damaged by the typhoon, with homes destroyed and mobile phone and internet access cut off.\n\nΓÇ£Communication lines are down.

        "content" : "MANILA (Reuters) ΓÇô The death toll from a Christmas typhoon that tore through the central Philippines rose to 28 on Friday, with 12 people missing, the disaster agency said, as authorities moved to restore power and residents tried to repair damaged homes.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone hit late on Tuesday with winds of up to 120 kph (75 mph) and gusts of 150 kph, dumping sheets of uninterrupted rain on a string of islands, damaging hundreds of homes and causing flooding in eight areas.\n\nIt was the seventh typhoon to strike the Philippines this year and came as millions of people in the predominantly Catholic country were heading home to celebrate Christmas with families.\n\nSome 43,000 people were in temporary shelters on Friday, among the 185,000 impacted by the typhoon, which destroyed 49 homes and partially damaged 2,000.\n\nThere was widespread travel disruption with 115 flights canceled and thousands of people stranded by the suspension of ferries due to storm surges.\n\nIt was unclear how the deaths occurred, but officials said some were hit by trees, electrocuted or drowned.\n\nΓÇ£People did not expect that the storm would be that devastating,ΓÇ¥ said disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal.\n\nThough less powerful than other typhoons this year, Phanphone made landfall in some of the countryΓÇÖs poorest and least-developed islands.\n\nAmong them was the island of Samar, which bore the brunt of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the PhilippinesΓÇÖ most powerful and deadliest storm on record. It killed more than 6,300 people.\n\nResidents there were clearing debris, with wooden pillars and sheets of corrugated iron roof that were once homes, scattered across the ground. Men pulled tried to recover fishing boats with tangled or damaged outriggers.\n\nSamar resident Virgilo Catayas, whose sibling was among those killed by Haiyan, said he lost another to hypertension when Phanphone hit.\n\nΓÇ£We canΓÇÖt really do much if thatΓÇÖs what happened, weΓÇÖll have to accept it,ΓÇ¥ he told broadcaster ABS-CBN. ΓÇ£The important thing is to stay strong,ΓÇ¥ he said, sitting next to a casket.\n\nTelevision showed minor damage to the airport at Kalibo, an alternative gateway to the holiday island of Boracay, while the disaster agency said 55 schools had suffered some damage.\n\nThe agriculture department estimated initial damages of 569 million pesos ($11.17 million) mostly to fish farms.\n\nImages on social media showed government workers clearing trees from roads, with a clear blue sky after the storm moved out over the South China Sea late on Wednesday.",

        "content" : "The death toll from Typhoon PhanfoneΓÇÖs battering of the Philippines on Christmas Day has risen to 28, and will likely climb further, authorities said on Friday.\n\nThe storm, with wind gusts of up to 200 kilometers, or 124 miles, per hour, swept across remote villages and popular tourist destinations in the central Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities on Friday confirmed 28 people had died, up from 16 on Thursday, as information came in from badly hit areas where internet and mobile phone networks had been cut.\n\nΓÇ£The likelihood is present that the casualty count will still increase. WeΓÇÖre hoping against it,ΓÇ¥ said national disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal.\n\nHe said at least 12 people were still listed as missing.\n\nAmong those killed were several members of a family who drowned, a policeman electrocuted by a toppled post while patrolling and a man struck by a felled coconut tree.\n\nThe Philippines is a mostly Catholic nation, and Phanfone ruined or disrupted Christmas festivities for hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe typhoon displaced tens of thousands living on the coast and low-lying areas who were forced to celebrate Christmas in evacuation centers.\n\nOthers missed family reunions, with plane and ferry services canceled.\n\nIt also hit Boracay island, famed for its white-sand beaches which draw more than one million tourists a year.\n\nCoconut trees were uprooted on Boracay and windows in some resorts were blown in during the storm, and ferry services to and from the island were cut on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nHowever, no one died on Boracay, and the damage was not on the scale of badly hit coastal towns elsewhere in the central Philippines.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt and is hit by an average of about 20 storms a year.\n\nPhanfone, locally named ΓÇ£Ursula,ΓÇ¥ is the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2019.\n\nMany of the storms are deadly and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇô the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nPhanfone blew out into the South China Sea on Thursday morning.\n\nIt was tracking towards Vietnam on Friday but forecast to weaken significantly into a low pressure area well before making landfall again.",

Thousands were left stranded as they tried to make their way home for Christmas.\n\nAccess to some islands off the coast has been hampered by the suspension of shipping by the coastguard.\n\nPhanfone struck close to regions hit by Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇô the most powerful storm ever to make landfall ΓÇô in 2013.\n\nMore than 6,000 people were killed in November that year, making it the PhilippinesΓÇÖ deadliest typhoon.\n\nExpressing his sympathy to a country overwhelming Roman Catholic, Pope Francis said ΓÇ£I join in the pain that affected the dear people of the Philippines because of the Typhoon Phanfone. I pray for the numerous victims, for the injured and for their families.ΓÇ¥\n\nHow great is the damage?\n\nTyphoon Phanfone made landfall on Tuesday night but continued to pass over the many islands of the central Philippines throughout Christmas Day.\n\nMore than 58,000 people had been evacuated in advance and about 15,000 others were stranded at ports when ferry services were suspended.\n\nThe extent of the damage began to emerge only on Thursday.\n\nMost deaths occurred in Iloilo and Capiz provinces.\n\nOne family was killed when they were swept away by a flash flood as they attempted to get to higher ground, the Philippine ABS-CBN network reports. At least 12 people reportedly went missing in Iloilo province alone.\n\nRichard Gordon, the chairman of the Philippine Red Cross, told the BBC: ΓÇ£A lot of people have lost their homes and they need food.ΓÇ¥\n\nWater and power services were cut in many areas, he added, and restoring them could take weeks.\n\nThe popular tourist island of Boracay appears to have suffered damage, although the extent is unclear.\n\nThe airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, Korean tourist Jung Byung-joon told AFP news agency.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage,ΓÇ¥ he said. ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs pretty bad.ΓÇ¥\n\nIn Tacloban, a low-lying city of more than 220,000 people, a large fire broke out as the winds rose but the city escaped the worst of the damage.\n\nTacloban suffered enormous damage during Haiyan and its storm surge.\n\nOn Thursday Phanfone headed out towards the South China Sea. -BBC\n\nRead More:\n\nChristmas typhoon Phanfone kills at least 13 in Philippines\n\nChristmas typhoon Phanfone kills at least 13 in Philippines\n\nTAGS Philippines storm typhoon Typhoon Phanfone\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\nWorld\n\nEconomy\n\nWorld",

One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly on Thursday as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph) after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the 20 deaths reported by national police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty, officials said.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power, government forecasters said.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.\n\n(This story was originally published on December 26, 2019)",

ItΓÇÖs pretty bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung Joon said via Instagram messenger.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within 100 meters of the airport looks broken.

        "content" : "Typhoon Phanfone swept across the central Philippines on Christmas Day, tearing roofs off houses. PHOTO: AFP\n\nMANILA: A typhoon that swept across remote villages and popular tourist areas of the central Philippines on Christmas Day claimed at least 16 lives, authorities said Thursday.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone, with winds of 195 kilometres (120 miles) an hour, tore roofs off houses and toppled electric posts as it cut across the Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nWith the internet and mobile phone networks still cut off in some badly damaged areas, a full assessment of PhanfoneΓÇÖs damage was not immediately possible on Thursday morning.\n\nBut at least 16 people had been confirmed killed in villages and towns in the Visayas, the central third of the Philippines, according to disaster agency officials.\n\nPhanfone also hit Boracay, Coron and other holiday destinations that are famous for their white-sand beaches and popular with foreign tourists.\n\nThe airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, according to a Korean tourist who was stranded there and provided images to AFP.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung Joon said via Instagram messenger.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within 100 meters of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled.\n\nΓÇ£Taxis are still running but itΓÇÖs windy and still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, including me. ΓÇ¥\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇö the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like the younger sibling of Haiyan.

It was packing winds up to 140 km per hour and gusts of up to 195 kph.\n\nPagasa weather specialist Aldczar Aurelio said the typhoon was moving west-northwest at 20 kph. He said the storm was expected to be over the West Philippine Sea by Thursday afternoon, gradually weakening as it neared the boundary line of Philippine territory.\n\nAurelio said Ursula would further lose strength by Saturday afternoon, turning into a tropical storm as it exited the country.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, tropical cyclone wind Signal No. 3 was raised in southern Oriental Mindoro, southern Occidental Mindoro, Calamian Islands and Caluya, while Signal No. 2 was up in Romblon, Batangas, Marinduque, the rest of Oriental Mindoro, the rest of Occidental Mindoro (including Lubang Island), Cuyo Islands, extreme northern Palawan, northern Antique and northwestern Aklan.\n\nBataan, Cavite, Laguna, the rest of northern Palawan, southern Quezon, Capiz, the rest of Antique and the rest of Aklan were under Signal No. 1.\n\nThough weaker, Ursula tracked the same path as Supertyphoon ΓÇ£YolandaΓÇ¥ (Haiyan), the PhilippinesΓÇÖ deadliest cyclone on record, which left more 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nWorst-hit provinces\n\nUrsula also battered Boracay Island in Aklan, with residents reporting damaged houses and flooding on Christmas Day.\n\nAmong the worst hit were Samar Island, Tacloban, Capiz and Aklan, and northern Iloilo and northern Antique.\n\nIn Leyte, strong winds blew three barges to shore at Barangay Punta, Ormoc City, on Tuesday night, the Coast Guard said. One of the barges hit a house, but no one was hurt, it said.\n\nNational Grid Corporation of the Philippines said three 138-kiloVolt lines and three 230-kV lines tripped at the height of the typhoon, cutting electricity to the entire island of Samar, Leyte, Biliran and Bohol.\n\nAll of Aklan and two towns in northern Antique also lost power after strong winds damaged the 138-kV Panit-an-Nabas line.\n\nParts of Iloilo and Capiz also experienced power outages.\n\nFlooding reported\n\nRoberto Nu├▒ez, Western Visayas civil defense director, said evacuation and flooding were reported in the northern areas of Panay Island, especially in Capiz and Aklan.\n\nCapiz Gov. Esteban Evan Contreras said among the worst flooded was President Roxas, where floodwaters reached chest-high in the town center.\n\nProvincial disaster officer Judy Grace Pelaez said Ursula, though weaker than Yolanda, brought heavier rains.\n\nShe said the provinceΓÇÖs first congressional district was first to report flooding, which was unusual because towns in the second district were usually the first to be flooded during typhoons.\n\nΓÇ£We are preparing for more flooding when the floodwaters from the second district flow into areas in the first district,ΓÇ¥ Pelaez said.\n\nAs Ursula moved west on Christmas Day, some evacuees were allowed to go home in Albay and Sorsogon provinces.\n\nIn Libon town, Albay, however, 251 evacuees were not allowed to return to their homes in Barangay Burabod that were damaged by a landslide on Dec. 2.\n\nIan James Secillano, municipal disaster official, said the evacuees would not be allowed to decamp until the government had provided a relocation site for them.\n\nΓÇ£As long as there is a threat of landslide, we will not allow them to go back to their houses. the long-term recommendation is to relocate them, probably in the nearby village,ΓÇ¥ Secillano said.",

Typhoon Phanfone began making landfall on Tuesday night, but continued to pass over the many islands of the central Philippines throughout Christmas Day. But the extent of the damage began to emerge only on Thursday.\n\nLocal media say at least 10 people had died ΓÇô including a three-year-old boy ΓÇô with most deaths occurring in Iloilo and Capiz provinces.\n\nBut Agence France-Presse, citing disaster agency officials, said at least 16 people had died.\n\nImage copyrightAFP\n\nImage caption\n\nResidents of the city of Ormoc capture a python displaced by the storm\n\nImage copyrightAFP\n\nImage caption\n\nOrmoc, in Leyte province, was one of the worst-affected areas  The PhilippinesΓÇÖ ABS-CBN network said that one family died when they were swept away by a flash flood as they attempted to get to higher ground. It added that at least 12 people were missing in Iloilo province alone.\n\nThe popular tourist island of Boracay appears to have suffered damage, although the extent is unclear.\n\nKorean tourist Jung Byung-joon told AFP that the airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was badly damaged.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage,ΓÇ¥ he said. ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs pretty bad.ΓÇ¥\n\nIn the city of Tacloban, a large fire broke out as the winds rose, but the city escaped the worst of the damage.\n\nTacloban suffered enormous damage during Typhoon Haiyan when a storm surge pushed water into the low-lying city of more than 220,000 people.\n\nAccording to an update by the Philippines weather service at 11:00 local time (03:00 GMT) on Thursday, Phanfone had passed over the most populated islands and was heading out towards the South China Sea.\n\nThe post Typhoon Phanfone: Philippines counts cost of deadly storm appeared first on Lovablevibes | Digital Nigeria Hip-Hop and R&B, Songs, Mixtapes, Videos.",

        "content" : "MANILA: A typhoon that swept across remote villages and popular tourist areas of the central Philippines on Christmas Day claimed at least 16 lives, authorities said Thursday. Typhoon Phanfone, with winds of 195 kilometres (120 miles) an hour, tore roofs off houses and toppled electric posts as it cut across the Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nWith the internet and mobile phone networks still cut off in some badly damaged areas, a full assessment of PhanfoneΓÇÖs damage was not immediately possible on Thursday morning. But at least 16 people had been confirmed killed in villages and towns in the Visayas, the central third of the Philippines, according to disaster agency officials.\n\nPhanfone also hit Boracay, Coron and other holiday destinations that are famed for their white-sand beaches and popular with foreign tourists. The airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, according to a Korean tourist who was stranded there and provided images to AFP. ΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung Joon said via Instagram messenger.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within 100 meters of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled. ΓÇ£Taxis are still running but itΓÇÖs windy and still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, including me. ΓÇ¥ Though much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇö the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like the younger sibling of Haiyan. ItΓÇÖs less destructive, but it followed a similar path,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer, an information officer at the Western Visayas regionΓÇÖs disaster officer, told AFP. Tens of thousands of people in the mostly Catholic nation had been forced to evacuate their homes on Wednesday, ruining Christmas celebrations.\n\nMany others were not able to return to their families, with ferries and plane services suspended. Among those killed Phanfone was a police officer who was electrocuted by a toppled electric post while patrolling.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of about 20 major storms a year. Many of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor. AFP",

        "content" : "In the capital, Manila, muddy, sewage-filled floodwater trapped Veronica ΓÇ£DerekΓÇ¥ CabeΓÇÖs family on the roof of their home.\n\nΓÇ£My family huddled together on the rooftop of our two-story house as the floodwaters sped past,ΓÇ¥ said Cabe, an environmental activist. ΓÇ£They could see bodies, animals, and even a coffin. It was like a horror movie.ΓÇ¥\n\nCabe got stuck a few miles away from her family. She was getting text message updates from them, but couldnΓÇÖt reach them.\n\nΓÇ£The fact that they were trapped in a life-and-death situation, and I had no idea how to help them was the worst nightmare that IΓÇÖve ever had,ΓÇ¥ Cabe told The World.\n\nSince that day, the Philippines has been slammed by storms again and again. In 2012, tropical storm Washi killed about 1,300 people. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan killed 6,000 people.\n\nThese kinds of storms and other disasters are expected to grow more intense as the climate warms. The bushfires raging across Australia are an example of how damages from climate change are likely to grow in the future.\n\nCabe is among those looking for someone or something to hold accountable for the damage caused by these catastrophes.\n\nΓÇ£What are we going to do, are we just going to count the dead bodies?ΓÇ¥ Cabe said. ΓÇ£There should be someone that should be accountable to this.ΓÇ¥\n\nIn 2015, Cabe signed onto a petition that asked the Philippines Commission on Human Rights to do just that. The commission agreed to investigate whether big oil and gas companies could be held legally responsible for harm caused by climate change.\n\nAnd the case is not unique. Citizens, nonprofit organizations and governments around the world are increasingly turning to the courts in their search for accountability.\n\nΓÇ£Litigation in the field of climate change has grown significantly in recent years,ΓÇ¥ said Alice Hill, a former judge and climate change policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nΓÇ£And itΓÇÖs anticipated that it will continue to grow on a number of fronts as we experience more impacts, and thereΓÇÖs greater anxiety about the very urgent need to cut emissions.ΓÇ¥\n\nHill calls some of these climate change lawsuits ΓÇ£failure to adaptΓÇ¥ cases. The plaintiffs are suing governments or businesses for not doing enough to protect people or their property from the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn Texas, the Army Corps of Engineers just fought and lost a case filed by homeowners claiming they didnΓÇÖt do enough to prevent flooding during Hurricane Harvey.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs those types of cases that will just be replicated across the nation,ΓÇ¥ Hill said, ΓÇ£because the damages are happening, and the courts are one of the most frequently sought-after places for people to get money.ΓÇ¥\n\nThe number of lawsuits against oil and gas companies is also on the rise.\n\nSeveral U.S. cities and states are suing for damages, seeking money to protect themselves from the impacts of climate change ΓÇö by building seawalls, for example.\n\nAttorneys general in Massachusetts and the U.S. Virgin Islands are also suing Exxon Mobil Corp. for misleading investors about climate change risk.\n\nNew York lost a similar case in December, and so far, Hill said, none of these big cases against oil and gas companies have been successful.\n\nΓÇ£We see in these large-scale cases the fossil fuel companies raising the issue that, ΓÇÿLook, everyoneΓÇÖs emitting carbon, and to point your finger at the fossil fuel companies isnΓÇÖt really fair,'ΓÇ¥ Hill said.\n\nThe science of climate attribution has advanced in the past few years, allowing scientists to estimate how much climate change contributed to the severity of an individual hurricane or drought.\n\nBut so far, litigants havenΓÇÖt been able to successfully prove that emissions from a specific company caused damages from a particular weather event. ItΓÇÖs a linkage, Hill said, that is typically required in many tort cases.\n\nGeographic expansion expected to continue in 2020\n\nClimate change lawsuits began in the litigious United States in the late 1990s, and for years remained largely a U.S. phenomenon.\n\nThat started to change after 2015 when a Dutch court ruled that the government had to cut emissions to protect the human rights of its citizens.\n\nΓÇ£A number of other countries and litigants started seeing how litigation could be used strategically against governments and against companies,ΓÇ¥ said Joana Setzer, a climate litigation expert at the London School of Economics and Political Science. That included cases in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, and Chile.\n\nSetzer predicts the trend is likely to continue in 2020, especially in developing countries.\n\nΓÇ£I expect to see more cases being brought in countries where either we havenΓÇÖt seen any case of strategic climate litigation or where thereΓÇÖs been one or two,ΓÇ¥ Setzer said.\n\nSome of those cases might come in the Philippines, where, in December, the head of the Commission on Human Rights announced on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference that the body had decided in favor of petitioners like Cabe looking to hold oil and gas companies legally responsible for future harm caused by climate change.\n\nThe full decision, expected to be released in early 2020, wonΓÇÖt be legally binding. But the activists behind the petition hope it lays the groundwork for future court cases.\n\nStill, even those behind these climate change cases recognize that the courts might not be the best place to fight the battle against rising carbon emissions.\n\nΓÇ£Courts canΓÇÖt make climate policies. Courts are obviously not the best intuition to deal with these issues,ΓÇ¥ said Dennis van Berkel, one of the lawmakers who worked on the landmark Dutch case that inspired climate lawsuits around the world.\n\nΓÇ£What courts can do is they can look at the facts and they can say, ΓÇÿWell, here the government really crossed the line,ΓÇÖ and what we really want is for governments not to cross the line, and to start acting in the interest of the people.ΓÇ¥\n\nVan Berkel and others hope that the threat of lawsuits will at least nudge them in that direction.",

        "content" : "ΓÇö Living in comfort in France never hinders a Filipina from lending a helping hand to her fellow Filipinos who are in dire need in Paris and even back home.\n\nMary Jane Souterre, who hails from Aklan, began helping hapless Filipinos in 2013, when Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), the most powerful storm that struck the disaster-prone Philippines that year, unleashed its fury in most parts of the Visayan region, including her hometown.\n\nIn November 2013, Souterre founded Coeurs ├á Coeurs, a charitable foundation that initially aims to improve the quality of life of victims of natural disasters in the Philippines.\n\nCoeurs ├á Ceours eventually expanded into a profit association that also extends help to Filipino migrants who are victims of modern slavery in France.\n\nSouterre, 62, is married to Patrick. They have two children, 34-year-old Kevin and 30-year-old Tifanny, who now both have successful careers.\n\nShe has a big heart for Filipinos because she also experienced the same before living a good life with her husband and two children in Paris.\n\nSouterre, the eldest female and third oldest of 10 siblings, was unable to finish high school since she came from a poor family.\n\nBut even if life was then cruel for her when she was still in Aklan, Souterre stayed a steadfast and persevering woman.\n\nIn 1979, she met Patrick while she was vacationing at the world-famous Boracay Island in Malay town in Aklan. Four years after, they decided to stay in France for good where she strived hard to live a comfortable life.\n\nWhile in France, Souterre opened her home to neglected Filipinos.\n\nSouterreΓÇÖs Coeurs ├á Ceours, based on its official Facebook page, also took the initiative to launch the ΓÇ£Bahay Kubo (Nipa Hut)ΓÇ¥ program, which intends to help Filipinos residing and working in France.\n\nCoeurs ├á Ceours also offered a skills-building program for Filipino migrants in France.\n\nDubbed as ΓÇ£Ate Jane,ΓÇ¥ Souterre has been receiving high regard not only from Filipinos whom he had helped one way or another but from from other nationalities as well.\n\nHer acts of kindness and compassion have helped her earn recognition after bagging the ΓÇ£Global Pinoy IdolΓÇ¥ award from Manila-based ABS-CBN Corp. in London, United Kingdom on Nov. 17, 2018.\n\nΓÇ£Global Pinoy IdolΓÇ¥ was organized by ABS-CBNΓÇÖs official AM radio station dzMM, in partnership with its international arm, The Filipino Channel, to pay tribute to overseas Filipinos who exhibit benevolence that makes a difference to the lives of other people.\n\nDespite her achievements, Souterre continues to help unfortunate Filipinos in France, and those in vulnerable and marginalized communities in the Philippines.\n\nApart from typhoon victims, those who were affected by series of deadly earthquakes that shook Mindanao last year also received aid from SouterreΓÇÖs Coeurs ├á Ceours.\n\nCoeurs ├á Ceours also continued to give assistance to the Aeta community in Central Luzon.\n\nIndeed, a comfortable life will never stop kind-hearted persons like Souterre from being a blessing to others.",

        "content" : "Today is Friday, Jan. 17, the 17th day of 2020. There are 349 days left in the year.\n\nToday's Highlights in History:\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1995, more than 6,000 people were killed when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 devastated the city of Kobe, Japan.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1806, Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, gave birth to James Madison Randolph, the first child born in the White House.\n\nIn 1916, the Professional Golfers' Association of America had its beginnings as department store magnate Rodman Wanamaker hosted a luncheon of pro and amateur golfers in New York City. (The PGA of America was formally established on April 10, 1916.)\n\nIn 1917, Denmark ceded the Virgin Islands to the United States for $25 million.\n\nIn 1945, Soviet and Polish forces liberated Warsaw during World War II; Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, credited with saving tens of thousands of Jews, disappeared in Hungary while in Soviet custody.\n\nIn 1955, the submarine USS Nautilus made its first nuclear-powered test run from its berth in Groton, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his farewell address in which he warned against \"the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\"\n\nIn 1977, convicted murderer Gary Gilmore, 36, was shot by a firing squad at Utah State Prison in the first U.S. execution in a decade.\n\nIn 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., ruled 5-4 that the use of home video cassette recorders to tape television programs for private viewing did not violate federal copyright laws.\n\nIn 1994, the 6.7 magnitude Northridge earthquake struck Southern California, killing at least 60 people, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nIn 1996, Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine followers were handed long prison sentences for plotting to blow up New York-area landmarks.\n\nIn 1997, a court in Ireland granted the first divorce in the Roman Catholic country's history.\n\nIn 2001, faced with an electricity crisis, California used rolling blackouts to cut off power to hundreds of thousands of people; Gov. Gray Davis signed an emergency order authorizing the state to buy power.\n\nTen years ago: Pope Benedict XVI paid a visit to a Rome synagogue, where he and Jewish leaders sparred over the World War II-era record of Pope Pius XII. Erich Segal, author of the best-selling novel \"Love Story,\" died in London at age 72. At the Golden Globes, top honors went to James Cameron's \"Avatar\" as well as the TV series \"Glee\" and \"Mad Men.\"\n\nFive years ago: Pope Francis braved an approaching tropical storm to travel to the far eastern Philippines to comfort survivors of the deadly Typhoon Haiyan. Bill Cosby performed to a welcoming Denver audience, despite a protest by some 100 people chanting \"Rape is not a joke!\" and \"No means no!\" outside the Buell Theatre.\n\nOne year ago: As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers were set to depart on a previously undisclosed trip to Afghanistan and Brussels, President Donald Trump denied use of a military plane for the trip, calling it a \"public relations event\" and saying it would be best if Pelosi stayed in Washington to negotiate an end to the government shutdown; the move came a day after Pelosi called on Trump to postpone his State of the Union address due to the shutdown. A judge in Chicago acquitted three police officers of trying to cover up the fatal 2014 police shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mary Oliver, known for her rapturous odes to nature and animal life, died at her Florida home; she was 83.\n\nToday's Birthdays: Actress Betty White is 98.

        "title" : "3 Ways Technology Helps Disaster Response in the Philippines",
        "content" : "Annually, about 10 tropical storms develop in the Philippines, with averages of eight to nine reaching land. These numbers do not include other disasters the country faces such as typhoons, earthquakes, monsoons and so on. Despite being one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, efficient communication with technology in the Philippines allows social media, Google Person Finder and satellites, to provide the best relief efforts. Keep reading to learn more about the top three ways technology helps disaster response in the Philippines.\n\n3 Ways Technology Helps Disaster Response in the Philippines\n\nSocial Media: Social media is indeed a connecting source and finds its strength in aiding the response to disasters with quickly spreading information that is, in turn, easily accessed. Popular media sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter updated by disaster area residents offer real-time updates about the current on-ground situation. Thanks to organizations such as the Standby Task Force, established in 2012 by Andrej Verity, these social media updates become pillars for relief and rescue. For example, in its use for supertyphoon Haiyan in 2013. These updates transform traditional on-ground humanitarian efforts into digital humanitarian efforts with online volunteers.\n\nThrough a streamlined process, volunteers tagged Haiyan-related social media posts. Then, sifting through them for relevancy, otherwise known as digital micro-tasking. Finally, submitting them to the U.N.ΓÇÖs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to compile a crisis map. With the widespread information thanks to social media, digital humanitarians take a hands-on approach to affecting the on the ground situation. Given that the combined concentration of thousands of volunteers provide time efficiency, a necessity when it comes to saving lives quicker.\n\nCommunication Technology: Other communication technology such as Google Person Finder assists in finding missing persons in the Philippines. For instance, in 2012, monsoon floods from Typhoon Saola caused increased landslides and flash floods; flooding at least 50 percent of the country and creating severe rescue conditions with strong currents. There were at least 900,000 affected families and 11 individuals missing. For those looking for the missing or stranded, GoogleΓÇÖs free Person Finder tool comes in extremely handy as all one needs to do is input the individualΓÇÖs name. At the same time, Google cross-references entries from other websites with information about missing persons to ping and locate leads.\n\nSatellite Technology: After Haiyan, most of the traditional methods of mobile communication infrastructure diminished, thus requiring the need for something more reliable, such as satellites. Learning from the Haiyan damage, the nationΓÇÖs most high-risk disaster areas now have mobile satellite equipment for easy deployment. This new tech brought forth by Inmarsat and the United Kingdom Space Agency, provides a reliable and sustainable communication method for the worst disaster days expected. Another example is the  Tacloban Health Cluster which utilizes satellites to canvas and coordinates public health response in the worst disaster-stricken areas, allowing better tracking of diseases and medical conditions throughout disaster times in hospitals and clinics. This data collection does not only help respond in real-time. Additionally, it is beneficial for understanding health trends after a storm to allow for a more proactive approach following the next impending storm the islands are known to face.\n\nΓÇô Elizabeth Yusuff Photo:  Flickr\n\nThe post 3 Ways Technology Helps Disaster Response in the Philippines appeared first on The Borgen Project.",

        "content" : "Last week, CCP Games announced that it was reviving its PLEX for GOOD campaign specifically to raise funds for victims of the Australian bushfires through EVE Online. Now, that campaign is live. In the studioΓÇÖs letter to players, it points out that 29 people have been killed in the fires, to say nothing of the uncountable animals, in a fire thatΓÇÖs essentially burned more area than CCPΓÇÖs home country of Iceland counts in total.\n\nΓÇ£PLEX for GOOD is a charitable program operated by CCP Games on behalf of EVE Online players. It provides a way for EVE players to donate to a charitable cause through the use of the digital currency PLEX. [ΓÇª] EVE players can contract PLEX in-game to the character CCP PLEX for GOOD and the real-world monetary value of all PLEX collected will be donated by CCP to the Icelandic Red Cross at the conclusion of the campaign on behalf of EVE Online players. The Icelandic Red Cross will ensure that the donated money is delivered to their counterparts in the Australian Red Cross where it will then be deployed to aid their humanitarian efforts in bushfire affected areas. We are requesting that players respect a minimum donation of 100 PLEX. This will help keep the processing of donations as efficient as possible while also allowing those with only a small amount of PLEX to participate.ΓÇ¥\n\nThe campaign runs through January 26th, though thereΓÇÖs another player-led charity event tomorrow as well. As weΓÇÖve previously noted, thereΓÇÖs been plenty of clamor for this drive from players, and CCP Games has been doing this sort of thing for at least 15 years, making it easier for players to donate to those affected by tragedies including earthquakes in NepalHaiti, floods in Pakistan, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, tornados in the US, and the tsunami that ravaged Japan in 2011. EVE Online players have raised nearly half a million dollars in these efforts.",

        "content" : "Happy 2020, deep down I think i was hoping for a slightly more positive first post for the decade. And while I have life updates to share (those will come later). Cause its 2020 and we need to talk about climate change and climate disastersΓÇª\n\nFrom the wildfires in Australia that are finally starting to make news burning more and more of their country. To floods in Indonesia hitting poorer communities hard. To typhoon Ursela that hit poor communities in the Visayas Philippines wiping out homes and communities including homes of extended family in some of my community. GodΓÇÖs creation has been crying out through the end of the decade into this new decade in 2020. And its time we stopped talking and listen to creation.\n\nThen the Taal Volcano erupted on January 12. A volcano that sits not far from the capital. A volcano that continues to spew Ash into communities far beyond the intial hit communities. Communities that the Cal-Pac Philippines Taskforce spent time in this past summer while we were in the Philippines, including a United Methodist Seminary. Churches & Seminaries as well as individuals, schools, and community centers are offering shelter to evacuees as whole communities have been displaced.\n\nThis event displaced thousands of Filipinos disrupting their economic livelihood and will continue to affect them emotionally and economically in the foreseeable future. This disaster will greatly affect the small farmers and fishermen ΓÇö the most vulnerable sectors of society. The full needs both urgent and long-term needs of displaced communities remain to be seen as the eruption is ongoing. But urgent support is needed now.\n\nLike when Typhoon Haiyan hit in 2013, we are coming together as church people, as United Methodist, as concerned community to begin to urgently fundraise. Donations at this time that are needed are financial donations for our long term partners on the ground can purchase the most urgent needs for the communities or medical supplies or meds (please contact me directly for the list of the needs) for an upcoming medical mission to the affected communities.\n\nI call on all my family and friends to give however much they can to help. Whether your Filipino or Fil-Am or not doesnΓÇÖt matter? Jesus never judged us based on our background. Its time we act not only in charity but in route to Justice, its time to give to the organizations where you know the money goes directly to those in need.\n\nCan you pass on one cup of coffee from the coffee shop and give the money to relief? Eat at home with your family and donate the money you would of spend eating out? Have a date night ΓÇ£inΓÇ¥ instead of ΓÇ£outΓÇ¥ and contribute Contribute in Honor of someone with a Birthday coming up, what a better gift? Have spare change you found in your couch, its been there for a while, send it to the Philippines. Can your church or organization take up a special offering or collection designated for the relief work in the Philippines?  How ever much you can give, is greatly needed and appreciated? I suggest three different organizations to give through depending on your location:\n\nThe National Alliance for Filipino Concerns (NAFCON) here in the United States has for over a decade been serving communities here in the United States and in the Philippines. NAFCON is working directly with NGOΓÇÖs in the Philippines who are based in the directly affected communities, serving the people and are there on the ground providing relief efforts. The organizations NAFCON member orgs partner with for Medical Missions and Solidarity Missions each year. There are personal relationships here. Your money will go directly to the communities (just as NAFCON did in 2013 during the response to Typhoon Haiyan). To donate click here and then click the donation button on the page. If you are United Methodist and/or prefer to give through the church, you can send a check to the Cal-Pac Philippines Taskforce and we will ensure your money gets to our long term partners with our yearly Pastoral & Solidarity Missions who are already on the front lines providing relief to the communities. Make Checks payable to ΓÇ£Cal-Pac Annual ConferenceΓÇ¥ put ΓÇ£Philippines-Taal EruptionΓÇ¥ in the memo line and mail checks to ΓÇ£Cal-Pac Annual Conference ATTN: JCEMT, Philippines Taskforce | PO Box 6006 Pasadena, CA 91102-6006. If you mail a check, give me a heads up so I can ensure it gets quickly to our partners on the ground providing ongoing relief. If you live in Hong Kong, You may send your donations to the following organizations who I served with during my time there. And I will personally guaranteed will see to it that the money gets to the people who are most in need on the ground in the hardest hit areas:CASH/CHEQUE DONATIONS  Payee: MFMW Limited  A/C #: 848-047866-838  Bank: HSBC\n\nFor direct transfers/deposits, please send a copy of the deposit slip by email to unifil.hk@gmail.com with the subject ΓÇ£Taal reliefΓÇ¥\n\nYou may send your cheque by mail (please write: for Taal Relief Fund at the back of the check) to:  MFMW Limted  c/o UNIFIL-MIGRANTE-HK  St. JohnΓÇÖs Cathedral, 4-8 Garden Road, Central, HKSAR\n\nSo I thank you for donating how ever you are able and how ever much you can!\n\nI also ask for prayers:\n\nPrayers for the survivors and those on the ground who have lost loved ones Prayers for those trying to get ahold of family members in the affected areas Prayers for those families have been displaced but to working overseas and other areas and unable to be with their loved ones Prayers for our community as we work to bring in relief donations for energy and that we stay united and support each other through the challenging moments  If you have any questions or would like more information, please donΓÇÖt hesitate to reach out and contact me directly.",

        "content" : "Resilience has become a popular catch phrase. I previously wrote about resilience with some suggestions on how to foster it. LetΓÇÖs take a step back and define what it means to be resilient.\n\nSource: Shutterstock - used with permission\n\nAdversity is a fact of life. Resilience is that ineffable quality that allows some people to bounce back after being knocked down by life. It allows positive behavioral adaptations in the face of stress, threats and adversity. Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back (Zolli and Healy) defines resilience as ΓÇ£the capacity of a system, enterprise, or a person to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of dramatically changed circumstances.ΓÇ¥ The American Psychological Association has suggested ΓÇ£10 Ways to Build ResilienceΓÇ¥ including develop self-confidence, take decisive action and maintain hope. Resilience skills necessary to bounce back psychologically after an illness are different than those required after a terrorist attack or the death of a loved one. However, there are some commonalities in terms of resilience which are useful across stressors.\n\nRather than letting difficulties or failure overcome or define them and drain their resolve, resilient people find ways to rise from the ashes. Psychologists have identified some of the factors that make a person resilient; optimism, positive attitude, ability to regulate emotions, and ability to see apparent failure as a positive learning consequence. Resilient people tend to be self-confident, intelligent, risk takers, have a strong desire to learn, able to identify and access social, psychological and physical resources that help maintain their well-being. Whether having these traits makes people more resilient or being resilient results in people gaining these beneficial qualities is not known. While optimism blunts the impact of stress on the mind and body in the wake of challenging experiences, it is difficult to find the silver lining while your family was the victim of a terrorist attack. Accessing your cognitive resources enables productive analysis of what might have gone wrong and offers alternative behavioral paths that could be more productive. Resilience requires real mTental work to transcend hardship.\n\nWhy do we care about resilience? Burnout is significant. 30-50% of physicians experience burnout. Resilience is also needed by children growing up in stressful and abusive homes, dealing with the loss of loved ones, coping with natural disastersΓÇöhurricane, flood, tornado, or with challenging illnesses, accidents, or terrorist attacks. Resilience allows us to pursue our goals despite external factors which might otherwise thwart our actions. Those with low resilience often blame external stressors, become overwhelmed, dwell on problems and suffer negative consequences of distress. High resilient people tend to take more personal responsibility, minimize blame and look at stressors as a healthy challenge rather than an immobilizing threat.\n\nSource: Shutterstock - used with permission\n\nWhile some challenges are greater than others, we are all faced with stresses, changes in circumstances and adversities; car breaks down, loved one dies, job loss, financial issues, illness, didnΓÇÖt get that client, going through a divorce, etc. Resilience research by sociologist Dr. Emmy Werner showed that about one-third of kids do not seem to be affected by poverty, alcoholism, and abuse in their homes. Many of the remaining two-thirds become troubled teens. Peter Schulman ( Journal of Selling and Sales Management) showed that optimistic insurance sales people sold 35% more than pessimists and were half as likely to quit in the first year. While there is a genetic component to resilience, it is also a learned trait.\n\nSource: Shutterstock - used with permission\n\nThe  Israel Trauma coalition (ITC) was created in 2002 (when Israel experienced an unprecedented number of terrorist attacks) to combat trauma and enhance resilience. Israel is the perfect place to study resilience because unfortunately traumatic experiences are an everyday occurrence and trauma preparedness and response in a necessity. The initial purpose of the ITC was to collect knowledge, expertise and experience of IsraelΓÇÖs leading trauma management centers and government organizations to provide direct care for those in need. The ITC has five city-wide Resilience Centers in southern Israel where 1,200 Israelis have been treated. Disaster preparedness training has also been provided to over 4,000 professionals in councils, hospitals, schools and businesses. The goal being to empower local staff to treat trauma, anxiety and stress.\n\nTikkun Olam: Tikkun Olam is a Hebrew term meaning \"Healing the world.\" The ITC has expanded beyond Israel to aid the international community with professional training, develop community resilience and enhance national emergency preparedness. The coalition sends teams all over the world to train local professionals and clinicians to manage traumas, promote rehabilitation and create resilient, self-sustaining societies. It is to places and situations like the hurricane Harvey in Houston, Boston Marathon bombing, typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, earthquake in Haiti, tsunami in Japan, school shooting in France, and terrorist attacks in Mumbai that the ITC provides psychological support and training. In the first few days following a major adverse event, Israel sends immediate and short-term humanitarian relief ΓÇô such as medical care, and debris clean up. The ITC then makes connections and assesses specific community needs in terms of psychosocial resilience, stress management, education, school and religious support, etc. They leave direct patient care to local experts who are better able to deliver effective treatment in a language and culturally sensitive manner. Early psychosocial interventions seem to decrease the likelihood and severity of later PTSD.\n\nSource: Shutterstock - used with permission\n\nITC is working with European countries to prepare vulnerable populations like vision- and hearing-impaired, elderly, youth and those with disabilities for disasters. One of their principles in helping people deal with trauma is to train the trainer. These sessions have been held in places like France, Sri Lanka, Mumbai, Germany, Japan and Haiti. One of the more important tactics is to build resilience so that people can more quickly return to routines and not become victims. Acknowledging feelings and telling their story allowed people (including traumatized professionals) to gain better perspective and more clearly channel their resources and see the importance of life beyond the trauma.\n\nAgain, as Israel is unfortunately one of the leading countries in the world on the receiving end of traumatic events, there are other agencies also working towards maintaining mental health and fostering resilience. One such agency, Amcha is the national Israeli center for psychosocial treatment and social support of Holocaust survivors (about 20,000 served) and their families. These were children who suffered from hunger, persecution, torture, loss and abandonment. Another Israeli agency, NATAL is the Israeli Trauma Center for Victims of Terror and War. NATAL has touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who suffered trauma; promoting emotional strength and resilience through treatment, prevention, public awareness and research.\n\nStressors come in many shapes and sizes. While stress is somewhat subjective, frequent traumatic events may lead to decompensation or great achievements depending on our level of resistance. Israel is an example of a resilient people in a resilient nation.\n\nThanks for following - comments always appreciated.\n\nThe next article will discuss the intense stress incurred by Israeli Yamam (anti-terrorist police unit) and how they foster ultimate resilience.",

Apple does not take any commission or costs of processing donations, which will go entirely to the charity.\n\nCurrently the donation system seems to be up and running in the united States and Australia. In both places, the donations will go to the national version of the Red Cross, while contributing specifically to the bush fires in australia. Banners appear on the local Apple.com the web pages, as well as the premises of the App Store.\n\nIn December, Tim Cook tweeted that Apple would be making a donation to the relief efforts in Australia.\n\nOur hearts are with those who are affected by the Australian bushfires and the courage of the volunteer forces of firefighting unprecedented across the countryΓÇöplease stay safe.

Previously, the company has accepted donations to the Red CrossΓÇÖs name in a wide variety of humanitarian incidents. These include Hurricane Sandy, the Tsunami in japan, the Philippines, the Typhoon Haiyan, and many more.\n\nWhile it is possible to make a donation by other means, Apple page streamlines the process of gift for anyone with an iTunes account. It also helps to raise awareness of the issue to people who, otherwise, may not be invited to make a donation.\n\nThe Australian bushfires are the result of record heat and severe drought. Thousands of firefighters and volunteers have been put into service. More than 6.3 million ha (63 000 sq km/15.6 million hectares) of bush, forest and parks were burned. 24 people have died as a result.\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?  n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;  n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version=ΓÇÖ2.0ΓÇ▓;n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;  t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,  document,ΓÇÖscriptΓÇÖ,ΓÇÖhttps://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.jsΓÇÖ);\n\n// stack social info  fbq(ΓÇÿinitΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿ309115492766084ΓÇÖ);  fbq(ΓÇÿtrackΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿEditorialViewΓÇÖ);\n\nHope You Like the News ΓÇ£ΓÇ¥ From BollyInside.

        "content" : "It seems not so long ago that with much anticipation, the world was on edge on New YearΓÇÖs Eve 1999 as we entered a new century. There were predictions that the internet and power grids throughout the world would shut down, that communications with air traffic could be impacted and clocks would stop working. It created what became known as Y2K hysteria for many.\n\nIn preparation for the possibility of catastrophic failures on Y2K, TIME magazine management set up a generator-powered ΓÇ£war roomΓÇ¥ in the basement of the Time & Life Building filled with computers and equipment ready to produce the magazine in case of a catastrophic breakdown of electricity and communications, according to then-assistant managing editor of TIME, Howard Chua-Eoan.\n\nMy wife and I threw financial caution to the wind and bought a bottle of limited-edition Dom Perignon champagne telling ourselves that it may be the last bottle of champagne we would ever enjoy. We ended up pouring it down the drain. Apparently, our champagne tastes are not enlightened enough to appreciate the vintage delicacy.\n\nAnd now 20 years later we have entered the decade of the 2020s. So much has happened at home and abroad in those 20 years, that it deserves a recap.\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant occurrences, particularly for the United States were the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, The Pentagon and a plane in mid-flight over Pennsylvania, which combined took the lives of an estimated 3,000 people. As a result of the 2001 attacks, the U.S. declared war and invaded Afghanistan in an attempt to overthrow the Taliban-led government.\n\nIn 2003, the U.S. invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein; protests followed worldwide and an eight-year war followed.\n\nFacebook was formed in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg as a way for Harvard students to communicate with each other.\n\nThe year 2005 brought the widespread devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which wreaked havoc on New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast of the U.S.; It was also the year YouTube was introduced to the world.\n\nIn 2006 Pluto was no longer considered a planet after the International Astronomical Union created the first formal definition of a planet. Those who memorized the names of planets with the acronym ΓÇ£Many Very Early Men Jumped Straight Up the North PoleΓÇ¥ were forced to remember the planetsΓÇÖ names in other ways.\n\nThe iPhone was introduced in 2007 by Apple; there have since been 12 newer versions of the iPhone.\n\nBarack Obama became the first person of color to hold the office of president of the United States in 2008.\n\nThe largest oil spill in U.S. history occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, in addition to the introduction of the iPad and Instagram.\n\nThe year 2011 brought a 9.0 earthquake in Japan that triggered a tsunami and the meltdown of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. Also in that year, the population of the world exceeded seven billion.\n\nVladimir Putin was elected president of Russia for the third time in 2012 and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings resulted in the deaths of 26 people, forever changing security measures at most public schools in the United States\n\nIn 2013, terrorist attacks occurred in Boston and Nairobi; Pope Benedict XVI resigned placing Pope Francis as the newest pope and Typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 6,150 people in the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nThe worst Ebola epidemic in recorded history occurred in West Africa in 2014, infecting nearly 30,000 people and resulting in the deaths of 11,000 as DeKalb CountyΓÇÖs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fought diligently to find a cure.\n\nAlso in 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur; there were 239 people on board the plane, which was never located. The shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by police led to violence and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, and other locations throughout the nation.\n\nThe heads of China and Taiwan met for the first time in 2015 and the U.S. and Cuba resumed diplomatic relations. Also occurring in 2015 was the church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, in which nine African Americans were killed during Bible study. Later in 2015, a shooter killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe year 2017 brought elevated tensions between the U.S. and North Korea after the country tested a hydrogen bomb and conducted a series of ballistic missile tests. Charlottesville, West Virginia was the site of a rally protesting the removal of Confederate statues throughout the U.S. during which a White supremacist rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters injuring 19 and killing one. Later in the year, 58 people attending a country music concert in Las Vega were killed in a mass shooting.\n\nThe first monkeys were cloned and first genetically modified humans were reported in China in 2018. The first summit between the U.S. and North Korea and the first crossing of the Korean Demilitarized Zone by a North Korean leader also occurred in 2018.\n\nPerhaps the biggest story of 2019 was the ongoing political bickering in Washington that led to the third impeachment of an American president as Donald Trump was charged with obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. The two previous impeachments were against Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.\n\nThe 21st century has certainly brought life-changing events to most parts of the world. We can only hope that the 2020 decade will bring peace.\n\n23 total views, 23 views today",

Smart stepped in and provided the tourism office of Boracay a SAT phone that was used by the public to send updates while mobile phone and internet networks were down.\n\nSmart, Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) CompanyΓÇÖs wireless subsidiary, first partnered with leading mobile satellite communications company Thuraya in 2016 for the use satellite devices and accessories during emergencies and disasters to facilitate faster communication and services even when cellular signal is compromised.\n\nThe Satellite phone, or the SmartSAT XT Lite, is a ΓÇ£handheld lightweight satellite phone which is handy during emergencies and disasters.ΓÇ¥ A handset may be used indoors through the use of SmartSAT Fixed Docking Unit. It offers SatSleeve Hotspot which turns an Android or iOS smartphone to a satellite phone.\n\nimportance of satellite phones was highlighted during Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) when the people of Tacloban had no other way to call for help. This led Smart to provide the government and other regional offices their satellite phones.\n\nΓÇ£Satellite phones are vital in maintaining communication between areas with compromised cell signal and the rest of the country,ΓÇ¥ said DOT in their statement posted on their Facebook page on January 9, 2020.\n\nAfter Boracay, DOT and Smart will provide other regional tourism offices SAT phones for emergency use.\n\nProject Noah has since moved back to the University of the Philippines where it continues to develop ways to help in disaster risk reduction.\n\nSEND cheers in the comments below to the countryΓÇÖs scientists for innovating on ways to address disaster risk reduction and management!",

Kami berharap untuk tidak melakukannya, jurubicara - Agen Judi Bola Terpercaya - kepada AFP.Dia mengatakan setidaknya 12 orang masih terdaftar sebagai orang hilang.Di antara mereka yang terbunuh adalah beberapa anggota keluarga yang tenggelam, seorang polisi tersengat listrik oleh tiang yang digulingkan saat berpatroli dan seorang pria dipukul oleh pohon kelapa yang ditebang.Filipina sebagian besar adalah negara Katolik, dan Phanfone merusak atau mengganggu perayaan Natal untuk ratusan ribu orang.Topan mengungsi puluhan ribu yang tinggal di pantai dan daerah dataran rendah yang dipaksa untuk merayakan Natal di pusat-pusat evakuasi.Yang lain ketinggalan reuni keluarga, dengan layanan pesawat dan feri dibatalkan.\n\nIni juga menghantam pulau Boracay, yang terkenal dengan pantai pasir putihnya yang menarik lebih dari satu juta wisatawan per tahun.Pohon-pohon kelapa tumbang di Boracay dan jendela-jendela di beberapa resor diterbangkan selama badai, dan layanan feri ke dan dari pulau itu dipotong pada hari Rabu dan Kamis.Namun tidak ada yang meninggal di Boracay, dan kerusakannya tidak pada skala kota-kota pesisir yang terkena dampak parah di tempat lain di Filipina tengah.Filipina adalah daratan besar pertama yang menghadapi sabuk topan Pasifik, dan dilanda rata-rata sekitar 20 badai per tahun.  Phanfone, yang secara lokal bernama \"Ursula\", adalah topan ke-21 yang melanda Filipina pada 2019.  Banyak dari badai itu mematikan, dan mereka biasanya menghapus panen, rumah dan infrastruktur, membuat jutaan orang terus-menerus miskin.Meskipun jauh lebih lemah, Phanfone melacak jalur yang sama dengan Super Typhoon Haiyan - badai paling mematikan di negara itu dalam catatan yang menewaskan lebih dari 7.300 orang atau hilang pada tahun 2013.Phanfone terbang ke Laut Cina Selatan pada Kamis pagi.Itu melacak menuju Vietnam pada hari Jumat tetapi diperkirakan akan melemah secara signifikan ke daerah tekanan rendah jauh sebelum membuat pendaratan lagi.",

In it I mentioned I Had read F.A Hayek's Road to Serfdom and used a quote from the book to argue against Government Intervention Referred to and discussed about cases of state intervention with (example of negligible intervention) Hong Kong under John James Cowperthwaite to (example of strong intervention) Keynesian policies employed such as the New Deal and Post War Consensus Mentioned having read Capitalism and Freedom, and noted how it shaped my view on the State's role of an economy Professed my personal economic beliefs to 'Positive Non-Interventionism' Noted as an extracurricular activity that I submitted an essay for a competition by organization which represented US Diplomatic Officers, talking about the US response to insurgencies in Iraq and Typhoon Haiyan. Discussed about whether the EU is a superstate, along with the wider Brexit argument and how it links with my interest in politics, namely about legislatures Noted how mathematical models is crucial in economics and how it has piqued my interest to explore further Filibusters in the US senate as well as the efficiencies of legislatures such as Congress and Parliament. I have served as a prefect in my school and that I have an amiable disposition I have done an assembly to promote Epilepsy Awareness Day Do you think that these points would be contributing to a strong personal statement- Would appreciate any feedback Last edited by Volkerbund1933; 7 minutes ago 0 reply",

(5th from right) and her team of volunteers always find it empowering to feed residents of the Homeless Shelter in Washington, DC. and the Lamp Center in Fairfax. Once week and on special holidays, Thelma and her husband George, have been able to enlist volunteers to help with their feeding program. They have sustained it for 25 years. The day before Thanksgiving, thousands were fed and provided winter clothes, blankets, sleeping bags, and hygiene kits. Majority of the food served are cooked and prepared at the Billy residence. Dozens of volunteers would go to her house around 10 a.m. to pack and load their vans, jeeps and cars. ThelmaΓÇÖs passion for charity work includes helping rebuild a church and more than a dozen homes in her hometown of Carles, Iloilo where Super Typhoon Haiyan caused massive damage. The recent earthquake in Southern Philippines has spurred her to act once again. She plans to help farmers who lost their homes in Barangay Buenavista in Kidapawan, Cotabato. Her team already identified 15 families. Each home would each cost $800. The Billys will do a site visit in mid-January to begin the project. A fund raising event held at the Knights of Columbus Hall at St. Leo Parish Church in Fairfax, Va. on January 4, raised additional funds for construction of the 15 homes. Among the guests, from left, Puring Manansala, Penny Reyes, Fely David, Penny's brother-in-law, Araceli Reyes, Thelma and Jun David. The Tutubi band provided the entertainment. By Bing Branigin",

        "content" : "[Photo/VCG] Vulnerable countries voiced frustration as the United Nations climate change negotiations ended in Madrid on Dec 13 after nearly two weeks of talks. Although the talks helped to marshal more than 80 countries to back stronger climate action in 2020, nations responsible for climate change came up short again.  Climate change pressures have come to a boiling point, with unprecedented shocks and simmering changes felt almost daily around the world.\n\nThe climate talks opened in Madrid with a media event organized by the 48-government Climate Vulnerable Forum, attended by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed and Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado.\n\nIt was again left to the small nations battered by climate crisis to deal with the fate of front-line communities. They reached out to China, which first came to their aid as the Marrakech negotiations wrapped up in 2016.\n\nMinister Xie Zhenhua, then head of ChinaΓÇÖs delegation to the 2016 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change talks, said at the Climate Vulnerable Forum high-level meeting in Morocco: ΓÇ£China notes the important role that the CVF plays in pursuing a 1.5 C world, and we applaud the collective voice of vulnerable countries to take climate action. China responds positively to the worldΓÇÖs call to ensure economic development and climate protection.ΓÇ¥ (Countries are seeking to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.)\n\nWe share far more problems than many imagine. Typhoon Haiyan, for instance, devastated the Chinese seaboard as well as the Philippines. Rising seas that threaten Dhaka and Manila are posing risks to Shanghai. The same glaciers whose disappearance threatens the Yellow and Yangtze rivers also puts into question the future of the Brahmaputra River, which flows through China, India and Bangladesh, and the hopes for prosperity of Bangladesh and other South and Southeast Asian nations.\n\nThe effects of climate change are most severe for countries dealing with geographical vulnerabilities such as low elevation and rain-fed agriculture.\n\nThe desire of vulnerable countries to transition to resilient, sustainable economies is dampened by expensive financing. Today, they face the reality of up to 10 percent higher capital costs on average, with another 10 percent capital premium predicted to apply over the next decade due to their climate vulnerability.\n\nBangladeshi Prime Minister Hasina rightly said at the opening of the Madrid climate talks: ΓÇ£In a further injustice, the vulnerable nations have been leading with ambitionΓÇ¥∩╝ìdespite the fact that climate action is structurally and financially easiest for the richest, most advanced nations.\n\nClimate support generally derives from developed countries, especially in Europe. European institutions are making good use of the European Union and international climate finance structures, for example to support investment funds that channel capital resources, subsidized by public finance, into ownership stakes in low-carbon investments in developing countries.\n\nYet most vulnerable countries have more to learn from fast progressing developing countries like China.\n\nChina leads the world today in renewable energy technologies. Vulnerable nations in the Climate Vulnerable Forum seek access to acquiring such technologies in order to pursue similar approaches.\n\nThere is much to learn from ChinaΓÇÖs experience with buildings and roads, advanced insulation, dikes and much more at a time when climate change presents for most vulnerable nations a daunting infrastructure challenge.\n\nConventional alliances, where the West reaches out to the climate vulnerable ΓÇ£global SouthΓÇ¥, make sense. Another alliance, however, would see key leaders outside the West, such as China, joining hands with CVF countries. This would be a strategic combination for climate protection and a most sensible global development and investment approach for ChinaΓÇÖs partners.\n\nSaleemul Huq is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, a Dhaka-based think tank. Renato Redentor Constantino is executive director of the Manila-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.",

        "content" : "The 2010s saw the U.S. economy, as well as the glass industry, recover from the Great Recession, ending the decade on a high note. Throughout the past ten years, the glass industry experienced major company changes as well as a shift toward resilient and sustainable building design.\n\nHere are the top stories of the decade* based on page views:\n\nTecnoglass Gains U.S. Base through Acquisition of Glasswall Assets ΓÇô The top three stories of the decade all centered on Tecnoglass Inc. In January 2015, Tecnoglass, headquartered in Barranquilla, Colombia, acquired the assets of Miami-based impact door and window manufacturer Glasswall, including a 160,000 square-foot manufacturing and office facility in Miami, manufacturing and assembly equipment and Miami-Dade Notice of Acceptance (NOA) for products manufactured and sold by Glasswall. An article from September 2015 about Tecnoglass commencing soft coat production was the number two story of the decade, while an article from July 2014 about Tecnoglass acquiring the assets of RC Aluminum Industries Inc. came in at number three. Glass Can Withstand 200 mph Winds, But What About Flying Debris? ΓÇô Another topic USGNNΓäó readers focused on in the 2010s was disaster resilience. This article, written in November 2013 during the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, which left thousands dead in the Philippines, focused on the ability of glass to withstand strong storms. BREAKING: PPG Sells Assets of Flat Glass Business to Vitro for $750 Million ΓÇô PPGΓÇÖs sale of its flat glass business assets to Mexican-based manufacturer Vitro was a major news story for the glass industry. The story broke in July 2016 and was followed with several updates, including a transition of leadership at the beginning of this year. One World Trade Center in a Glass of its Own ΓÇô New York CityΓÇÖs One World Trade Center is one of the tallest buildings in the world. And, at least according to one organization that knows a thing or two about tall buildings, itΓÇÖs one of the best. This article from July 2015 looks at why the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat named One World Trade Center one of its four 2015 Best Tall Building winners. Lawsuit Raises Questions About Windows Melting Vinyl Siding ΓÇô A lawsuit in Oregon over melted vinyl siding revisited the question of what role, if any, windows might play in the melting of vinyl siding. This article, published in November 2016, gives an overview of the lawsuit involving Michael Harney of Beaverton, Ore., who sued Associated Materials of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the makers of Alside siding, for not honoring its warranty after Harney said a house he sold in October 2015 had melted siding.  * EditorΓÇÖs note: The Google analytics data available goes back to January 2013, so the top stories exclude any prior to that time.",

        "title" : "Kai Anya to Market Enhanced DOST RTE Arroz Caldo",
        "content" : "(SDN) ΓÇö READY-TO-EAT (RTE) Arroz Caldo, anyone?\n\nIf plans do not miscarry, an improved RTE Arroz Caldo shall be available in supermarkets for every Filipino.\n\nBy then, what was initially created for disaster victims shall then be available to the general public.\n\nThis future development emerged after a meeting on December 5, 2019 at the Industrial Technology Development Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-ITDI).\n\nIt was a meeting between Chief Nelia Elisa C. Florendo of the Technological Services Division (ITDI-TSD) and Kai-Anya Food, Inc. Plant Manager Milagros G. Bagaporo and her Quality Assurance (QA) Supervisor Marvin N. Malasa.\n\nTheir discussions focused, among others, on the food firmΓÇÖs desire to pursue several product development plans for the ready to consume meal.\n\nThe Kai-Anya officials informed the ITDI officials their product development plans for RTE Arroz Caldo cover product improvement/reformulation, packaging system and design integration, product expansion, market positioning through Halal certification.\n\nIn their plans also is the possibility of making the food concoction available in supermarkets for the general public. ItΓÇÖs part of the companyΓÇÖs diversification of its product line.\n\nResearchers of the ITDI created the RTE Arroz Caldo in 2014, in response to lessons learned in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda (international name: Haiyan). Kai Anya is a technology adopter of the ITDI located at the DOST Compound in Bicutan, Taguig City, Metro Manila.\n\nIt can be recalled that the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda that barreled through parts of the Visayas exposed the governmentΓÇÖs inadequacy in providing thousands of the affected families with quick servings of food. Many disaster survivors went hungry for several days because of the breakdown of local government unitsΓÇÖ (LGUs) services and business establishmentsΓÇÖ lack of resilience ΓÇö damage to infrastructures and agriculture was massive (communication networks, roads, bridges, public institutions, farmlands, etc.)\n\nITDI took the cue from their. To make a long story short, Packaging Technology Division (ITDI-PTD) cooked up what it branded a ΓÇ£Pack of Hope,ΓÇ¥ which is known as the RTE Arroz Caldo with chicken.\n\nThe PTD headed by Daisy Ta├▒afranca categorized the food concoction ΓÇ£as disaster food ready to eat without drinkables.ΓÇ¥\n\nΓÇ£Without drinkablesΓÇ¥ is the characteristic that obviously sets the RTE Arroz Caldo apart from the emergency food stockpiles of LGUs and the Department of Social Work and Development (DSWD) ΓÇö such as canned foods, noodles, coffee, rice and crackers.\n\nThe RTE Arroz Caldo does not need fire and water because it was already cooked and ready for consumption; for the usual emergency food supplies mentioned earlier, disaster victims have to have fire and water or electricity for heating them. But as ΓÇ£YolandaΓÇ¥ more than amply demonstrated, electricity, water, and gas were not available in the disaster zone.\n\nAnd without electricity, water and gas preparing food was next to impossible. Disaster or not.\n\nThe ITDI cited Kai AnyaΓÇÖs goal of increasing its volume of production.\n\nΓÇ£To do this, Kai Anya is currently building a new facility. Further, a newly approved financial assistance from DOSTΓÇÖs Small Enterprises Technology Upgrading Program (SETUP) has enabled it to acquire a water retort, a new addition to their line of production equipment. Presently, product packaging is done through a private toll packing facility,ΓÇ¥ the DOST agency said.\n\nAt present, the company is already producing RTE Arroz Caldo packed in stand-up retort pouches that has a life span of one year. Kay-Anya produces and sells the product to DSWD for distribution as emergency relief goods for victims of disaster/calamities.\n\nThe ITDI-PTD developed the ΓÇ£Pack of HopeΓÇ¥ food preparation which is expected to alleviate disaster victimsΓÇÖ agony through a complete meal in every pack ΓÇö no need to add water and heat.\n\nTa├▒afranca said they developed the RTE Arroz Caldo ΓÇ£as a disaster mitigation/relief food to address immediate hunger of disaster victims. It has a shelf life of one year.ΓÇ¥\n\nThe packaging structure is sturdy, light and very handy, she added, and designed to withstand aerial distribution of about 800-1,000 feet for the distribution in flood areas or in disaster zone that cannot be reached by land because of damage to infrastructures.

The death toll of 41 ΓÇô up from 28 on Friday ΓÇô included three boat crew who died after their vessel capsized due to strong winds, a policeman electrocuted by a toppled post, and a man struck by a felled tree.\n\nThe latest agency report showed over 1.6 million people were affected by the typhoon, which damaged over 260,000 houses and forced almost a hundred thousand people to flee to emergency shelters. Though less powerful than other typhoons this year, Phanphone made landfall in some of the countryΓÇÖs poorest and least-developed islands. Among them was the island of Samar, which bore the brunt of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the PhilippinesΓÇÖ most powerful and deadliest storm on record. It killed more than 6,300 people.\n\nMany of the affected residents in the predominantly Catholic nation celebrated Christmas in evacuation centres, where they may have to stay until the New Year given the scale of destruction.\n\nPower lines and internet connections remain down in some areas after PhanfoneΓÇÖs powerful wind gusts of up to 200 kmh toppled electric posts and trees.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone, is the 21st cyclone to hit the storm-prone Philippines, which is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt.",

        "content" : "Manila: The official death toll from Typhoon Phanfone has risen to 47 and is likely to keep rising as  nine more persons are reported missing, the government said on Monday.\n\nIn its updated report, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said the dead were recorded in four regions in the central Philippines and the northeastern tip of Mindanao island in the southern Philippines.\n\nThe disaster agency said 16 died in Iloilo, five in Capiz, five in Aklan, one in Cebu, one in Southern Leyte, five in Leyte, one in Biliran, five in Eastern Samar, one in Samar, five in Oriental Mindoro and two in Occidental Mindoro provinces. At least 140 people were injured, it added.\n\nPolice and local officials said most of the  deaths were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nThe agency said the typhoon caused over 1 billion pesos (roughly 19.7 million U.S. dollars) in damage.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone, which made landfall on Tuesday afternoon in Eastern Samar province, left a trail of destruction as it barrelled through towns and villages across the central Philippines and parts of Mindanao.\n\nThe typhoon forced hundreds of thousands of villages to abandon communities prone to flood and landslides, toppled trees and electrical posts, and ripped off tin roofs before blowing into the South China Sea on Saturday.\n\nThe NDRRMC said Phanfone affected over 1.7 million villagers in 6,510 villages in six regions. As of Sunday, the agency said 106,309 people are housed in 635 temporary shelters.\n\nA total of 372 schoolhouses, nearly 305 houses, 31 health facilities and 98 government offices were damaged by heavy rain and fierce winds, the agency added.\n\nThe agency said the typhoon stranded people who were rushing home to spend Christmas with their loved ones in the provinces as 54 roads and bridges were affected, and forced the cancellations of 116 domestic and three international flights. Sea travels were also halted.\n\nPhanfone is the 21st typhoon to hit the Philippines this year. About 20 typhoons and tropical storms batter the Philippines each year. Aside from typhoons, the archipelago of more than 100 million people has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe Philippines is one of the  most disaster-prone countries in the world mainly due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire and Pacific typhoon belt.\n\nIn 2013, the World Bank said Typhoon Haiyan resulted in the loss of 6,300 lives and caused an estimated 12.9 billion U.S. dollars in damages, or about 4.7 percent of the PhilippinesΓÇÖ gross domestic product.",

        "content" : "The death toll left by Typhoon Phanfone, which sliced through the central Philippines on Christmas Day, has reached 28 and may still climb, officials said Friday.\n\nDisaster officials said that of the total figure thus far, four were recorded in the province of Capiz; two in Aklan province; 13 in Iloilo; one in Southern Leyte; one in Cebu; two in Leyte; one in Biliran; three in Eastern Samar; and one in Western Samar.\n\nMark Cashean Timbal, spokesman for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, said that most of the deaths were due to drowning, electrocution or trauma from fallen debris. Twelve more people were reported missing while 45,000 families were displaced and staying in evacuation centers, he said.\n\nΓÇ£There are ongoing rescue operations for those residents trapped in their homes due to flooding. We have deployed our damage assessors to find out the extent of destruction,ΓÇ¥ Timbal said.\n\nPacking maximum sustained winds of 195 kph (120 mph), the typhoon, locally known as Ursula, made multiple landfalls after hitting Salcedo town in Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve, according to the state weather agency.\n\nIt also slammed into Tacloban City in Leyte province where Super Typhoon Haiyan, locally known as Yolanda, landed with devastating fury in 2013, leaving over 6,000 people dead.\n\nA number of domestic flights were cancelled while hundreds of passengers at the port in Manila were stranded after ferry services were suspended.\n\nNonoy Espina and Mark Navales  Bacolod and Cotabato, Philippines\n\nCopyright ┬⌐2019, BenarNews.

        "content" : "The Past Can Save the Future\n\n29 12 2019  Where did all that time go? This is my last IBI Watch post of 2019. For all but the purest of purists, this is also the end of a decade ΓÇô the 2010s. Yes, I know 2020 will technically be the last year in this decade, but with commentators of so many stripes taking the plunge with their summaries, who am I to abstain from all the fun?\n\nWith an initial beg for forgiveness from my non-local readers, here is a Minnesota summary and a kvetch. Minnesota is getting wetter, and this is inextricably linked to unfettered, human-caused climate change. My home region of Minneapolis-Saint Paul will close 2019 with the highest precipitation total in history. We broke the old record already a month ago. That old mark? Hardly old at all ΓÇô 2016. And with the ugliest of multi-day slop storms currently melting down what was winter, itΓÇÖs a safe bet the old record will be obliterated. Another safe bet is that this new record wonΓÇÖt last long.\n\nMy kvetch? I despite this liquid winter weather in a land that once boasted what I call a ΓÇ£solidΓÇ¥ winter. That is, sub-freezing temps and enduring snow cover being pretty much the rule, with only brief warmer interludes, from middle November to early March. As the old professor, Casey Stengel, used to say, ΓÇ£You can look it up.ΓÇ¥\n\nSummaries and recaps serve many purposes, but one of the best is jogging our memories. Staying with the Twin Cities for just a moment, those of us who pay attention at all know that this weirdly warm winter weather is no longer an anomaly ΓÇô itΓÇÖs the ΓÇ£new abnormal.ΓÇ¥ Minnesota State Climatologist Kenny Blumenfeld reminds us that this sort of unwelcome holiday dousing, with accompanying ice for awhile anyway, also happened about this time last year. And in 2016. Notice a trend? Here is a quote from the latest edition of a very informative and entertaining group e-mail that Kenny sends out each time ΓÇ£interestingΓÇ¥ weather looms.\n\nΓÇ¥ ItΓÇÖs been a complete dud of a December, with inactive weather, a lot of clouds, and then initially cool to cold weather replaced by an absurd bout of mild conditions. As of right now, nothing about December will be memorable. By [the end of the month], however, we may have some new and lasting memories. Of course, you have heard about this, because some meteorologist on the local news, or on That One Cable Channel, or even on your whispering public broadcasting network, has gawked, squawked, and possibly even drooled right onto the microphone over what looks like a complete monster of a storm, thrashing the region [over the weekend]. Of course, such a storm would completely transform what we think of this December. Dud nothingΓÇª\n\nIf the above passage reads like something I would write to this list about the upcoming storm, itΓÇÖs because thatΓÇÖs what I wrote to the list last year (2018), in anticipation of a  strangely similar post-Christmas storm. And look at that stormΓÇÖs predecessor from Xmas 2016! Apparently,  wet, late-December northern US storm systems are having lots of babies.ΓÇ¥\n\nSo, big winter melts, interrupted by occasional polar blasts, some related to the rapidly melting Arctic and the ever-loopier, weakening jet stream, are our weather future here in east-central Minnesota. Blech!\n\nAs I said, I see value in recaps. To learn what one mainstream news source found important the past year, I turned to CNN. Here is one of their ΓÇ£Nine in 2019.ΓÇ¥ This one is CNNΓÇÖs Brian StelterΓÇÖs nine most consequential media stories in 2019. They range from ΓÇ£who cares?ΓÇ¥ (Jeff BezosΓÇÖs battle with the National Enquirer for instance) to quite weighty (impeachment, and StelterΓÇÖs number 1, the assault on truth, led by TrumpΓÇÖs near-complete avoidance of actual facts). StelterΓÇÖs rundown is worth a glance, but the story I think he is ignoring is the most consequential of all. Fortunately, his colleague Brooke Baldwin placed at the very top of her nine-story list the one that touches all others. Now, if only the mainstream media would adjust their focus to what in the long run matters most. That is, climate activist Greta Thunberg being selected as Time MagazineΓÇÖs Person of the Year for leadership of a growing movement to solve the rapidly worsening climate crisis.\n\nSo much for my extended complaint. And now for a little perspective. Up until now, though climate changeΓÇÖs effects in Minnesota have been annoying and disappointing, they pale in comparison with what residents of other parts of the world have been dealing with. And not merely in 2019. Remember that, true decade end point or not, we are looking at decadal summaries and recaps.\n\nHave a look at the most memorable ΓÇô and concerning ΓÇô storms of the 2010s. Remember Harvey? Florence? How about Hurricane ΓÇô sometimes called Superstorm ΓÇô Sandy, that pounded New York in 2012? All those storms are from the 2010s. And four of the five costliest storms ever have occurred since 2010. The outlier? Not far back at all ΓÇô Katrina, in 2005.\n\nWhatΓÇÖs happening? Easy. Storms in general, tropical cyclones in particular, are intensifying, thanks to rapidly warming oceans. EarthΓÇÖs oceans absorb an outsized percentage of humanityΓÇÖs greenhouse gas emissions. And now itΓÇÖs time for a bit more perspective. The typhoon that just battered the Philippines was a passing shower compared to Typhoon Haiyan from 2013. That monster killed more than 6300 people, in a country that has contributed relatively little to the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. HowΓÇÖs that for unfairness?\n\nWith these intensifying storms, accelerating polar ice melt, bush fires and record heat in Australia, etc., a thinking person wonders ΓÇô where is all this leading? As you will see, there are plenty of causes for pessimism, along with some shaky causes for optimism. In this NPR story, Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science for the Union of Concerned Scientists, lays out both the worst and best news on climate. She points out that while weather emergencies proliferate, the world has made huge progress in clean, renewable energy. And while she acknowledges that the US federal government under ΓÇ£instinctually science-savvyΓÇ¥ Trump is in the process of abandoning the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and any deliberate interest by the feds in cutting emissions, others in the US are bucking Trump and working hard to clean up. Cities and states in large numbers are striving to meet American goals from Paris, may the federal government under Trump be damned. She goes on to point out in some detail how the rapid price drops for solar and wind energy have made those clean sources more affordable than coal-generated power.\n\nAll of this is well and good. But where is the clarion call for conservation? Yes, tech is part of the answer. But far from the be-all and end-all solution. Using less energy overall is clearly a much bigger part. And remember that even technological innovation and conservation together are not the solution. A combination of innovation, a lifestyle shifts and policy changes in a whole range of areas, all pursued together, is the only possible route to solving the climate crisis.\n\nHere is a summary of the ideas that were in front of world leaders at the recently concluded climate preservation negotiations in Madrid. Remember, we need all these ideas, not one or just a few.\n\nEnergy Massive energy efficiency and conservation Replace fossil fuels with low-and no-carbon renewables Eliminate fossil fuel subsidies Wealthy nations must assist poorer nations in de-carbonizing their economies Put a price on carbon emissions   Short-lived pollutants Reduce emissions of methane, soot and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)   Nature Protect and restore EarthΓÇÖs ecosystems Restore forest land, and protect remaining forests Provide up to one-third of emissions reductions needed by 2030 in order to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius by pursuing the full range of natural solutions   Food Encourage plant-based diets Pursue minimum-till and no-till agriculture Drastically cut food waste   Economy Curtail materials extraction and overexploitation of ecosystems, as driven by relentless pursuit of economic growth Shift goals away from GDP growth and wealth accumulation toward prioritizing basic needs, thus reducing inequality Build understanding that the economy is a subset of the environment; not vice versa (my wording, totally in keeping with the spirit of the report)   Population Drastically yet humanely curtail the current rate of increase (net increase in human population of 80 million per year, or over 200,000 per day) Make family planning services available to all Achieve universal gender equality, including primary and secondary education for all, especially girls and young women.    ThatΓÇÖs quite a daunting list of policy initiatives, but each will have a positive impact. And we need all, not one, not just a few. And the fact that the climate talks ended in frustration and disarray ΓÇô again ΓÇô is no excuse for inaction.\n\nThe overriding goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord was straightforward ΓÇô put the world on a path to curtail greenhouse gas emissions so that the overall global rise in temperatures would not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. Bad news ΓÇô that rise is pretty much locked in, say most scientists. And even a 2.0-degree rise is looking more unlikely, considering the relentless upward trend in greenhouse gas emissions since 2015. Should we give up, and place all emphasis on mitigation and, god forbid, geoengineering? I donΓÇÖt think so. Just the same, it is essential that we appreciate the gravity of the problem, and then get to work solving it.\n\nThis piece from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) serves up the hard facts, with accompanying interactive charts. The news? If we had had the foresight to listen to the likes of James Hansen back in 1988, curtailing and finally eliminating greenhouse gas emissions would have been akin to a brisk walk in the park. Now it is more like climbing a sheer rock face with no place to grab and hold on.\n\nIf you followed the MIT link, you see how, year by year, we are making the task of resolving the climate crisis harder, and the odds against success longer. Still, we cannot give up the fight.\n\nIf we have any hope for progress and solutions, Trump and his greedy corporatist henchmen must go. That may be harder than seems logical, considering all the environmental damage he and his environmental demolition team have already done ΓÇô and what they will do if given a second chance in 2020. Think a Trump re-election is far-fetched? Think again.\n\nIf you are a regular reader of this blog, you know that I most strongly support the most progressive candidates (Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) among the crowd of Democrats competing to oppose Trump in November 2020. I believe any one of them would be an improvement over Trump, who has gone to ludicrous extremes recently to lash out at pretty much anything that hints at resource conservation. The only question is ΓÇô how much of an improvement, considering the stakes? Where do they stand on climate? ItΓÇÖs a mixed bag ΓÇô see for yourself.\n\nTrumpΓÇÖs plan for dealing with the climate crisis is to deny that it exists, and worse ΓÇô in defiance of science ΓÇô push policies that will make the climate emergency dramatically worse. We have no choice but to replace him.\n\nCan we do it? The decadal recaps that matter, and the forecasts that emerge, converge on this truth:\n\nWe need a new direction, to save ourselves and the Earth that sustains us. And the longer we put off concerted action, the steeper and more painful the climb to real solutions.\n\nSounds like we need the Green New Deal.\n\nLetΓÇÖs make it so. LetΓÇÖs use what weΓÇÖve observed and learned as powerful lessons in saving the future for ourselves and those who will follow us. The past can indeed save the future. But only if we make it happen.\n\nHappy 2020!\n\nDate : December 29, 2019",

Over 97,000 are currently living in temporary shelters.\n\nSeveral boats, some 52 roads, and two bridges were also damaged and nearly 90 municipalities were left without electricity.\n\nThe damages caused by the typhoon were estimated to be worth over 1,074 million pesos ($21 million) with more than 265,000 homes, 372 schools and 29 health centres affected.\n\nAccording to the Department of Agriculture, over 43,000 farmers and fishers were affected, while more than 46,000 hectares of rice, corn, and cassava fields were damaged.\n\nThe typhoon caused cancellations at airports, ports and bus stations and affected thousands of travellers on Christmas Eve.\n\nBetween 15 and 20 typhoons make landfall in the Philippines every year during the rainy season, which begins around May and June and usually ends between November and December.\n\nIn November 2013, Haiyan, one of the most powerful typhoons ever to hit the Philippines ΓÇô with winds up to 315 km per hour ΓÇô caused 6,300 deaths, with more than 1,000 people missing and 14 million affected by a tsunami that swept away several kilometres of coastline.",

        "content" : "AFP/Manila\n\nThe death toll from Typhoon PhanfoneΓÇÖs battering of the Philippines on Christmas Day has risen to 28, and will likely climb further, authorities said yesterday.  The storm, with wind gusts of up to 200 kilometre per hour, swept across remote villages and popular tourist destinations in the central Philippines on Wednesday.  Authorities yesterday confirmed 28 people had died, up from 16 on Thursday, as information came in from badly hit areas where internet and mobile phone networks had been cut.  ΓÇ£The likelihood is present that the casualty count will still increase.  WeΓÇÖre hoping against it,ΓÇ¥ national disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said.  He said at least 12 people were still listed as missing. Among those killed were several members of a family who drowned, a policeman electrocuted by a toppled post while patrolling and a man struck by a felled coconut tree.  The Philippines is a mostly Catholic nation, and Phanfone ruined or disrupted Christmas festivities for hundreds thousands of people.  The typhoon displaced tens of thousands living on the coast and low-lying areas who were forced to celebrate Christmas in evacuation centres.  Others missed family reunions, with plane and ferry services cancelled. It also hit Boracay island, famed for its white sand beaches which draws more than a million tourists a year.  Coconut trees were uprooted on Boracay and windows in some resorts were blown in during the storm, and ferry services to and from the island were cut on Wednesday and Thursday.  However no one died on Boracay, and the damage was not on the scale of badly hit coastal towns elsewhere in the central Philippines. The Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of around 20 storms a year. Phanfone, locally named ΓÇ£UrsulaΓÇ¥, is the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2019.  Many of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.  Though much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇö the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013. Phanfone blew out into the South China Sea on Thursday morning.It was tracking towards Vietnam yesterday but forecast to weaken significantly into a low pressure area well before making landfall again.",

Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.\n\nAP\n\nChristmas  Philippines",

        "content" : "If there was one place that has been long overdue in my travel list, it would be the province of Iloilo.\n\nSparking my interest after making a video about it for work back in 2018, I was easily captivated by this Visayan province because of its beautiful and well-preserved Spanish colonial buildings and heritage sites that made my architecture-fan heart happy and want to fly to the place immediately. However, story of the latter materializing took a while because of lack of companion and my parents disapproving of my solo traveling until I learned that one of my previous colleagues and her friends are flying to the place the following year serving as go signal for this anticipated trip.\n\nWith more than a year of planning, I was able to study and meticulously pick out the places that I really want to visit and see in the City of Love. Aside from the city itself, my friend and I also included trips to the picturesque Isla de Gigantes and some famous tourist spots in the southern part of the province. I also wanted to include a visit to the town of Leon to see IloiloΓÇÖs Little Baguio but due to time constraints, decided to exclude this and save it for my next trip. After some couple of research and necessary bookings, we were able to come up with our three-day itinerary and for our first day we decided to go to northern part of Iloilo.\n\nDAY 1 ΓÇô Northern Iloilo 12:25AM ΓÇô ETA in Iloilo 12:30AM to 1:00AM ΓÇô Travel to Airbnb from airport 1:00AM ΓÇô Arrive in Airbnb 1:00AM to 4:00AM ΓÇô Rest 4:00AM to 8:00PM ΓÇô Travel to Bancal Port 8:00AM to 8:30AM ΓÇô Change into swimming attire; Quick breakfast 8:30AM ΓÇô Call time for Isla de Gigantes tour 8:30AM to 4:10PM ΓÇô Isla de Gigantes tour 4:10PM to 4:30PM ΓÇô Wash up and change clothes 4:30PM to 8:30PM ΓÇô Travel to Iloilo City 8:30PM to 9:30PM ΓÇô Dinner at Breakthrough @ SM City Iloilo 9:30PM onwards ΓÇô Go back to hotel and rest\n\nWe arrived in Iloilo International Airport past midnight where we rode a cab going to our booked Airbnb in the city that took us around 30 minutes to reach. Upon arrival and agreed, we immediately looked for the security guard who the owner entrusted to take care of our bags since our booked room is still occupied by another guest with an overlapping schedule with us. After changing our clothes and realizing that we donΓÇÖt have a place to stay in the AirbnbΓÇÖs premises during the time, we then started our early travel to our first stop for the day which was Isla de Gigantes.\n\nLocated in the northern municipality of Carles, Isla de Gigantes is IloiloΓÇÖs famous tourist spot known for its picturesque fine-sand islands and distinct blue waters. A newcomer in the usual century-old attractions in the province, the discovery of Gigantes was accidental when rescue officers spotted its beautiful islands while on a mission after the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda (a.k.a. Typhoon Haiyan) to nearby provinces in 2013. Ever since, the place started gaining popularity and became a must-visit when traveling to Iloilo.\n\nFrom the city, Isla de Gigantes can be reached by taking a bus or van bound to Carles in Tagbak Terminal in Jaro District. For our trip and since weΓÇÖve arrived very early in the place, we took the 2AM van bound for Bancal Port, the jump-off point to Gigantes, which costs Γé▒250 per head. Travel time can take up to four hours but due to the early time, our trip was cut short to around 2.5 hours.\n\nVarious tour organizers offer package trips to Isla de Gigantes which what we opted when we visited the tourist spot. However, in case you come unprepared, there are also local organizers in Bancal Port that will offer you trips to the place. A handful of eateries can also be found in the port for travelers who would like to have a quick snack before starting their day. It was also here where we had our breakfast with a complementing view of the sea.\n\nAfter our 8:30AM call time and registering in the tourism office, we finally boarded the boat that we will be taking to visit the five islands in our list. First stop was Pulupandan Islet which is located 30 minutes away from the port.\n\nCharacterized by the lone palm tree that stands in the middle of the place, Pulupandan is one of the first islands that will welcome visitors upon their start of their Gigantes tour. Aside from the palm tree, thereΓÇÖs also surrounding rock formations found the place and nipa huts that seem to become a shelter of fishermen when the weather is bad. Honestly, thereΓÇÖs nothing really special about this small islet but if youΓÇÖve been wanting to see and experience the island life literally, Pulupandan would be a delight for you.\n\nSeveral minutes away from Pulupandan Islet is the star of Gigantes Islands that is Cabugao Gamay.\n\nThe most photographed among all of the islands found in the place, Cabugao Gamay became the image of both Gigantes and the municipality of Carles because of its beautiful overlooking view that features the clear blue waters of its surrounding sea. Aside from the viewing deck that offers those Instagram-worthy shots, there are also shell and stone displays located below that are up for photo ops. Swimming is also allowed to fully experience the beauty of the place.\n\nAlready visible from Cabugao Gamay was our third stop for the day that is called  Bantigue Sandbar. Being my first time to see a sandbar, I was keen to visit this place which offered a panoramic view of the sea and the nearby islands and experience watching small waves come in all directions when standing at the edge of the sandbar. It was also here where I fully observed how clear and distinctly blue Gigantes waters are. Tourists who would like to take home scallops can buy ones here for Γé▒1 per piece.\n\nAfter minutes of swimming and taking in the beauty of Bantigue, we then proceeded to our fourth destination for the day which was Antonia Beach.\n\nMore established and commercialized compared to the first three islands, Antonia Beach boasts of surrounding limestone formations similar to the ones found in Palawan. Hungry visitors could also dine in the place as there is a resort serving foods in the area. Snorkeling is a popular activity in the beach to catch a glimpse of some sea creatures living beneath its waters. If relaxing is your idea of spending time in the beach, small nipa pavilions are also available to use in the area.\n\nWe spent our time in the beach lounging and catching some Zs in one of the placeΓÇÖs nipa pavilions before being called by our tour guide for our next and last destination of the tour which was Lantangan Beach. The first four islands were more beautiful than in our next stop but the thought of our complementing tour lunch being served here made me look forward of seeing this place.\n\nUnlike in the previous islands, our boat did not dock in the shore as it was too shallow for anchoring, hence, we needed to get off and walk to reach the land. The waterΓÇÖs temperature rose as we got nearer and when weΓÇÖve finally reached the shore, our tour guide directed us to go inside a nipa house where our lunch was waiting for us. Delight registered on my face when I saw the handful of seafood meals served right before us.\n\nFresh from the sea, I particularly enjoyed both the steamed and dried scallops that tasted well when dipped in a chili vinegar and when partnered with hot rice. There was also a serving of wasing-wasing, fried fish whose name I wasnΓÇÖt able to ask and a bowl chicken soup that seemed to taste like a tinola (Filipino chicken soup) minus the veggies. I actually enjoyed our seafood feast in the place that when a kid approached us and offered dried scallops, I did not hesitate of buying one to take home.\n\nAfter a hearty meal and paying our remaining balance for the tour, we walked back to our boat and headed back to Bancal Port where we officially ended our Gigantes tour and washed up before being taken back to the city by the tourΓÇÖs third-party van service. Fare costs Γé▒260 which dropped us off directly in front of our Airbnb after four hours of travel.\n\nOur supposed part two of seafood feast at Breakthrough was postponed due to its distance as we were expecting to be dropped off from our tour at SM City Iloilo. Hence, we just decided instead to grab dinner at the nearby Atria Park District and explore the area before finally returning to our Airbnb and to gain energy for our second day in Iloilo.",

        "content" : "The number of people killed by a typhoon that battered the Philippines over the Christmas period has risen to 28, say officials.  Typhoon Phanfone, which made landfall on Tuesday, caused severe floods and destroyed homes in several provinces.  According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council, 12 people remain missing.  The typhoon led to the evacuation of more than 58,000 people and stranded thousands over the holiday period.  Officials said some of the dead were hit by trees, while others were electrocuted or drowned.  \"The likelihood is present that the casualty count will still increase. We're hoping against it,\" disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal told news agency AFP.  Phanfone struck close to regions hit by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people - making it the Philippines' deadliest storm.  Typhoon Phanfone, known locally as Typhoon Ursula, made its way through many islands of central Philippines on 25 December.  It reached winds of 200kmph (125 miles per hour), leaving thousands stranded as they tried to make their way home for Christmas.  Western parts of Visayas, the central of the three main island groups that make up the Philippines, were among the worst affected. In lloilo province, at least 13 people died.  According to news site Rappler, six people from the same family were killed while visiting the town of Batad for a family funeral.  The popular tourist island of Boracay was also damaged by the typhoon, with homes destroyed and mobile phone and internet access cut off.  \"Communication lines are down. Electricity is still down,\" Jonathan Pablito, a police chief in Alkan province, an island neighbouring Boracay, told agency AFP on Thursday.  Tacloban, a low-lying that was destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan, was also among those affected. However, the city escaped the worst of the damage this time round.  The typhoon is said to have eased in strength on Thursday and has headed towards the South China Sea.",

        "content" : "World Typhoon Phanfone: At least 28 dead in the Philippines after devastating storm hits on Christmas Day\n\nThe storm hit as many were preparing to begin their Christmas celebrations in what is a predominantly Roman Catholic country\n\nA typhoon has left at least 28 dead and more than 12 missing after it barrelled through the central  Philippines on Christmas Day.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone forced thousands to flee their homes, putting an end to  Christmas celebrations in what is a predominantly Roman Catholic country.\n\nOthers were left stranded at sea and in airports during the peak holiday travel season, as landslides, flooding, and failed power supplies added to the problems.\n\nAs houses were  destroyed and trees felled, one disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a \"ghost town\" on Christmas Day.\n\nSevere typhoon\n\n\"You can't see anybody because there was a total blackout, you can't hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,\" Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defence said.\n\nThe storm weakened as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 74mph and gusts of 93mph, after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on 25 December, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the deaths reported by police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees, and electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then ploughed across the archipelago's central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gyms and schools turned into emergency shelters.\n\nMany more people spent Christmas Eve in bus stations.\n\nChoppy waters\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coastguard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters.\n\nDozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were cancelled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The south-east Asian nation is also located in the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the world's most disaster-prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, travelled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than five million people in the central Philippines in 2013.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA",

Many of the communities were still recovering from the impacts of Typhoon Kammuri which hit the areas earlier this month.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone (known locally as Ursula) made landfall seven times between 24 and 25 December causing devastation across The Philippines.\n\nOxfam Philippines Country Director Maria Rosario Felizco said: ΓÇ£Oxfam is deeply concerned for the communities hit by Typhoon Phanfone. Many people were still struggling to get back on their feet after another typhoon earlier this month.ΓÇ¥\n\nOxfam is working closely with local humanitarian agency PeopleΓÇÖs Disaster Risk Reduction Network (PDRRN) to assess the damage from the storm. Teams visited four towns in Leyte and Eastern Samar and found severe damage to homes with many families living in makeshift shelters.\n\nEsteban Masagca, PDRRN Executive Director said:\n\nΓÇ£Families are urgently requesting emergency shelter materials because the storm completely destroyed their homes. Families need bedding and mosquito nets, especially as dengue continues to be a major threat in the communities. Water refilling stations arenΓÇÖt operating, because there is no power and clean water kits will be crucial to prevent diseases, as many sources of water have been contaminated. Thousands of families will enter the New Year without food or a home.ΓÇ¥\n\nOxfam staff member Leah Payud, based in Leyte, where the typhoon made one of its landfalls, described the devastation experienced by her community: ΓÇ£The typhoon has carved the same path as Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Although weaker, itΓÇÖs devastating impacts are widely felt, especially here in Leyte, where houses have been damaged and electric posts toppled. We spent Christmas Day in total darkness.ΓÇ¥\n\nFelizco said: ΓÇ£Oxfam and our partners are working closely with local government and other humanitarian agencies to ensure the immediate needs of survivors are addressed effectively. We will prioritize the needs of women and girls throughout our emergency assessment and response.ΓÇ¥",

WeΓÇÖre hoping against it,ΓÇ¥ disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal told news agency AFP.\n\nPhanfone struck close to regions hit by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people ΓÇô making it the PhilippinesΓÇÖ deadliest storm.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone, known locally as Typhoon Ursula, made its way through many islands of central Philippines on 25 December.\n\nWhat are hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons?  It reached winds of 200kmph (125 miles per hour), leaving thousands stranded as they tried to make their way home for Christmas.\n\nWestern parts of Visayas, the central of the three main island groups that make up the Philippines, were among the worst affected. In lloilo province, at least 13 people died.\n\nAccording to news site Rappler, six people from the same family were killed while visiting the town of Batad for a family funeral.\n\nThe popular tourist island of Boracay was also damaged by the typhoon, with homes destroyed and mobile phone and internet access cut off.\n\nΓÇ£Communication lines are down. Electricity is still down,ΓÇ¥ Jonathan Pablito, a police chief in Alkan province, an island neighbouring Boracay, told agency AFP on Thursday.\n\nTacloban, a low-lying that was destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan, was also among those affected. However, the city escaped the worst of the damage this time round.\n\nThe typhoon is said to have eased in strength on Thursday and has headed towards the South China Sea.",

        "content" : "Twenty-eight people prayed when Typhoon Phanfone hit the Philippines on Christmas Day, according to a new report announced on Friday by the authorities, who fear that this figure will only increase further. Accompanied by gusts 200 km / h, the tropical storm crosses from east to west the islands of the center of the archipelago, some of which are very touristy.\n\nAuthorities reported the death of 28 people on Friday, while the previous death toll was 16. The information takes time to come up from the most distant, which for some were still deprived Friday of mobile coverage and internet network.\n\nIt is likely that the balance sheet will worsen further, warned the spokesman of the agency for disaster management Mark Timbal, specifying in particular that at least 12 people were missing.\n\nChristmas gch\n\nAmong the victims were several members of the same family who drowned, a police officer who was electrocuted by the fall of a power line while on patrol, or a man who was struck by a coconut tree .\n\nThe passage of the typhoon also had the effect of disrupting Christmas celebrations for tens of thousands of people in an archipelago over 80% Catholic. Many people living near the sea or in flood-prone areas have been forced to flee their homes to celebrate Christmas in these evacuation centers.\n\nQuantities of ferry flights and rotations have been canceled.\n\nDracin trees\n\nPhanfone also hit the island of Boracay, a jewel of the Visayas whose white sandy beaches attract more than a million tourists each year. Trees have been rooted there and hotel complexes have had their windows broken. But no deaths were reported on the island, which no ferry joined on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nAbout twenty typhoons and tropical storms sweep the Philippines each year on average, killing hundreds of people. In mid-December, a violent tropical storm in the north of the country left 13 people dead. By devastating crops and homes, these calamities contribute to endemic poverty.\n\nPhanfone, named Ursula in the Philippines, was the 21st cyclone to hit the archipelago in 2019. It followed the same trajectory as the Haiyan supertyphon, the most devastating recorded in the country, which had killed more than 7,300 dead and missing in 2013, especially the town of Tacloban. Phanfone left the Philippines on Thursday morning by the South China Sea, where it had already lost much of its intensity on Friday.\n\n(Nxp / afp)",

        "content" : "PHOTO: bbc.com\n\nA deadly Christmas typhoon has swept across the central Philippines region, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake and killing at least 21 people. With much of the areaΓÇÖs communications remain cut off, the full extent of the damage or fatalities is not yet known. Typhoon Phanfone, known locally as Typhoon Ursula, made landfall on Eastern Samar province in the Philippines on Tuesday, with heavy rain and storm surges flooding coastal communities. It had the equivalent strength of a Category 1 hurricane, packing sustained wind speeds of 150 kilometres per hour\n\nAFP reports that the typhoon struck busy tourist locations such as Boracay and Coron on Christmas Day, as well as more remote villages. Roofs were ripped off properties and the winds knocked down electrical poles. One falling pole electrocuted and killed a police officer.\n\nJung Byung Joon, a Korean tourist stuck at the badly damaged Kalibo airport, which serves Boracay, says roads remain blocked, with a lot of passengers stranded due to cancelled flights, yet unable to leave the airport due to strong winds and heavy rain. Mobile phone and internet services on the holiday island of Boracay was cut during the storm as it passed through on Christmas day; the networks remained down on Thursday.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty bad. Everything within 100 metres of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled. Taxis are still running but itΓÇÖs windy and still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, including me.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô Jung Byung Joon/Instagram\n\nThe typhoon has ruined the Christmas holiday in the strongly Catholic country, with tens of thousands having to leave their homes and others unable to complete their journeys to family and friends due to transport services being cancelled.\n\nThe Philippines experiences about 20 serious storms every year, with the entire archipelago facing the Pacific typhoon belt. Typhoons regularly destroy homes and other infrastructure, as well as ruining harvests, leaving many of the countryΓÇÖs farming communities stuck in a state of permanent poverty.\n\nPhanfone followed a similar path to 2013ΓÇÖs much stronger Super Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in the region.\n\n.",

Thousands were left stranded as they tried to make their way home for Christmas.\n\nAccess to some islands off the coast has been hampered by the suspension of shipping by the coastguard.\n\nPhanfone struck close to regions hit by Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇô the most powerful storm ever to make landfall ΓÇô in 2013.\n\nMore than 6,000 people were killed in November that year, making it the PhilippinesΓÇÖ deadliest typhoon.\n\nExpressing his sympathy to a country overwhelming Roman Catholic, Pope Francis said ΓÇ£I join in the pain that affected the dear people of the Philippines because of the Typhoon Phanfone. I pray for the numerous victims, for the injured and for their families.ΓÇ¥\n\nHow great is the damage?\n\nTyphoon Phanfone made landfall on Tuesday night but continued to pass over the many islands of the central Philippines throughout Christmas Day.\n\nMore than 58,000 people had been evacuated in advance and about 15,000 others were stranded at ports when ferry services were suspended.\n\nThe extent of the damage began to emerge only on Thursday.\n\nMost deaths occurred in Iloilo and Capiz provinces.\n\nOne family was killed when they were swept away by a flash flood as they attempted to get to higher ground, the Philippine ABS-CBN network reports. At least 12 people reportedly went missing in Iloilo province alone.\n\nRichard Gordon, the chairman of the Philippine Red Cross, told the BBC: ΓÇ£A lot of people have lost their homes and they need food.ΓÇ¥\n\nWater and power services were cut in many areas, he added, and restoring them could take weeks.\n\nThe popular tourist island of Boracay appears to have suffered damage, although the extent is unclear.\n\nThe airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, Korean tourist Jung Byung-joon told AFP news agency.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage,ΓÇ¥ he said.

        "content" : "The devastation wrought by Typhoon Phanfone, which made seven landfalls in the Philippines between Christmas Eve and Day, has left an urgent need for humanitarian assistance, Oxfam and its partners say.\n\nOxfam Philippines Country Director Lot Felizco said many of the communities impacted by Typhoon Phanfone, known locally as Ursula, were still recovering from the impacts of Typhoon Kammuri (local name: Tisoy) and were in dire need of support.\n\nΓÇ£Oxfam is deeply concerned about the situation of communities hit by Typhoon Phanfone which made seven landfalls in 24 hours beginning on Christmas Eve ΓÇö usually a time for celebration and thanksgiving in the Philippines. Many of the communities are still struggling to get back on their feet in the wake of Typhoon Kammuri, which hit earlier this month,ΓÇ¥ Ms Felizco said.\n\nOxfam staff member Leah Payud, based in Leyte where the typhoon made one of its landfalls, described the devastation experienced by her community.\n\nΓÇ£Ursula carved the same path as Typhoon Haiyan in 2013,ΓÇ¥ Ms Payud said. ΓÇ£Although weaker, its devastating impacts are widely felt, especially here in Leyte, where houses have been damaged and electric posts toppled. We spent Christmas Day in total darkness.ΓÇ¥\n\nOxfam is working closely with humanitarian organisation PeopleΓÇÖs Disaster Risk Reduction Network (PDRRN) to assess the damage from the storm. Teams immediately visited four municipalities (towns) in Leyte and Eastern Samar, where Oxfam has ongoing projects.\n\nAccording to Esteban Masagca, PDRRN Executive Director, early assessments by staff and volunteers indicate coastal villages urgently need emergency shelter materials, beddings, potable water and food. Power outages, loss of access to infrastructure such as schools and markets, and severe damage to houses along the shore also loom as serious problems post-disaster.\n\nMr Masagca said: ΓÇ£Families are urgently requesting emergency shelter-grade materials because the storm completely destroyed their homes along the coast. Families need beddings and mosquito nets, especially as dengue continues to be a major threat in the communities. Potable water is urgently needed since water-refilling stations cannot operate because of the ongoing power blackout. Water kits and disinfectants are crucial to prevent water-borne diseases since many sources of water have been contaminated. It truly saddens us that thousands of families will enter the New Year without food, or even homes.ΓÇ¥\n\nMs Felizco said: ΓÇ£Families will need support during this time of great need. Oxfam and our partners are working closely with local government and other humanitarian actors to ensure the immediate needs of survivors are addressed effectively. We will prioritize the needs of women and girls throughout our emergency assessment and response.ΓÇ¥\n\nOxfam has been working in the Philippines for 30 years to address the underlying causes of poverty through its various programs on economic justice, conflict transformation, gender justice and rights in crisis.",

One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph), after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the deaths reported by police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in seaports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including two popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster-prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.\n\n3 mph NNW  92%\n\n5 mph WNW  97%\n\n5 mph N  97%",

        "content" : "Christmas typhoon leaves 28 dead, 12 missing in Philippines\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nMANILA, Philippines (AP) ΓÇö A strong typhoon that barreled through the central Philippines left at least 28 dead and 12 missing, and forced thousands to flee their homes, devastating Christmas celebrations in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone stranded many people in sea and airports at the peak of holiday travel, set off landslides, flooded low-lying villages, destroyed houses, downed trees and electrical poles and knocked out power in entire provinces. One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph), after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the deaths reported by police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

ItΓÇÖs pretty bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung Joon said via Instagram messenger.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within 100 meters of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled.\n\nΓÇ£Taxis are still running but itΓÇÖs windy and still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, including me.ΓÇ¥\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇô the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like the younger sibling of Haiyan. ItΓÇÖs less destructive, but it followed a similar path,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer, an information officer at the Western Visayas regionΓÇÖs disaster officer, told AFP.\n\nTens of thousands of people in the mostly Catholic nation had been forced to evacuate their homes on Wednesday, ruining Christmas celebrations.\n\nMany others were not able to return to their families, with ferries and plane services suspended.\n\nAmong those killed Phanfone was a police officer who was electrocuted by a toppled electric post while patrolling.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of about 20 major storms a year.\n\nMany of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.\n\nChristmas Day,  Philippines,  typhoon",

One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly on Thursday as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph) after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the 20 deaths reported by national police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty, officials said.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power, government forecasters said.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

        "content" : "Associated Press\n\nDecember 26, 2019 at 6:47 am December 26, 2019 at 6:47 am\n\nBy JIM GOMEZ\n\nMANILA, PhilippinesΓÇö A strong typhoon that barreled through the central Philippines left at least 20 people dead and forced thousands to flee their homes, devastating Christmas celebrations in the predominantly Catholic country.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone stranded many people in sea and airports at the peak of holiday travel, set off landslides, flooded low-lying villages, destroyed houses, downed trees and electrical poles and knocked out power in entire provinces. One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly on Thursday as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph) after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the 20 deaths reported by national police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty, officials said.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power, government forecasters said.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

        "content" : "A typhoon that swept across remote villages and popular tourist areas of the central Philippines on Christmas day claimed at least 16 lives, authorities said on Thursday.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone, with gusts reaching 200 kilometres (125 miles) an hour, tore roofs off houses and toppled electric posts as it ripped through the central Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nVideos from the typhoonΓÇÖs path showed fallen trees and strong winds pummelling flimsy houses. Local disaster officials cut felled trees to clear blocked roads.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed in villages and towns in the Visayas, the central third of the Philippines, according to disaster agency officials.\n\nPhanfone also hit Boracay, Coron and other holiday destinations that are famed for their white-sand beaches and popular with foreign tourists.\n\nMobile phone and internet access on Boracay was cut during the storm and the networks remained down on Thursday, making assessment of the damage there difficult.\n\nΓÇ£Still, communication lines are down. Electricity is still down,ΓÇ¥ Jonathan Pablito, police chief of Malay town in Alkan province, which is on an island neighbouring Boracay, told AFP.\n\nPablito said ferry services between Boracay and Aklan ΓÇö the main way to travel to and from the holiday island ΓÇö were still not operating on Thursday, even though the storm had passed.\n\nΓÇ£We have no news from coast guard if ships were allowed to sail. Since the 24thΓÇª all those going to the island and coming from the island werenΓÇÖt able to cross.ΓÇ¥\n\nThe airport at Kalibo town in Aklan, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, according to a Korean tourist who was stranded there and provided images to AFP.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung-joon said via Instagram messenger.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within 100 meters of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled.\n\nΓÇ£Taxis are still running but itΓÇÖs windy and still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, including me.ΓÇ¥\n\nAnother Korean tourist stuck at the damaged airport said she had been unable to make contact with her friend on Borocay on Thursday.\n\nΓÇ£I tried to call my friend in Boracay today and wasnΓÇÖt able to get through. Maybe something isnΓÇÖt working,ΓÇ¥ Dahae Gong told AFP via Instagram.\n\nΓÇ£I donΓÇÖt know when I will be able to go home.ΓÇ¥\n\nΓÇô Memories of monster storm ΓÇô\n\nStill, there was no indication of any major damage or otherwise on Boracay.\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇö the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like the younger sibling of Haiyan. ItΓÇÖs less destructive, but it followed a similar path,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer, an information officer at the Western Visayas regionΓÇÖs disaster bureau, told AFP.\n\nIn San Jose town in Occidental Mindoro, a video uploaded by the local government showed overturned fishing vessels and ruined shanties on the coast due to the storm.\n\nTens of thousands of people in the mostly Catholic nation were forced to evacuate their homes on Wednesday, ruining Christmas celebrations.\n\nMany others were not able to return to their families, with ferries and plane services suspended.\n\nAmong those killed was a police officer electrocuted by a toppled post while patrolling.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of about 20 major storms a year.\n\nMany of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.\n\nDec 25",

        "content" : "MANILA, Philippines (AP) ΓÇö A strong typhoon that barreled through the central Philippines left at least 20 people dead and forced thousands to flee their homes, devastating Christmas celebrations in the predominantly Catholic country.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone stranded many people in sea and airports at the peak of holiday travel, set off landslides, flooded low-lying villages, destroyed houses, downed trees and electrical poles and knocked out power in entire provinces. One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly on Thursday as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph) after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the 20 deaths reported by national police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty, officials said.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power, government forecasters said.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

        "content" : "The typhoon Phanfone, which razed in its path tourist parts and isolated villages of Philippines During Christmas, he has left a balance of at least 16 people dead, according to a report published Thursday. Phanfone reached winds of up to 195 kilometers per hour, destroyed numerous homes and demolished part of the electricity service wiring, according to official Philippine sources. A report from the response agency to natural disasters reported that 13 people died in the Western Visayas region, while a local official told AFP that three other people had perished in the center of Philippines. Authorities fear there are more victims, as the typhoon continues to hit the country, including important tourist destinations such as Boracay and Coron, famous for their white sand beaches.\n\nKalibo airport, from where the planes to Boracay take off, was severely damaged by Phanfone on Thursday, according to Korean tourists who were trapped in the air terminal unable to travel and who provided images to AFP. ΓÇ£The routes are blocked, although there are already some efforts to remove the debris. The situation is quite bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung Joon said through a communication via Instagram. ΓÇ£Everything within a 100-meter radius around the airport is broken. There are many frustrated people at the airport because many flights were canceled.ΓÇ¥ Although considerably less serious, Phanfone followed the same path as the Haiyan super-typhoon, which in 2013 devastated the country and left more than 7,300 people dead.\n\nPhanfone ΓÇ£is like a younger brother of Haiyan. He is less destructive, but he has followed a similar path,ΓÇ¥ said Cindy Ferrer, an official with the disaster relief office in Western Visayas. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes during Christmas. However, evacuation tasks could not be followed according to the plans since many planes and ferries could not work.",

        "content" : "Christmas typhoon leaves 20 dead in Philippines\n\nMANILA, Philippines (AP) ΓÇö A strong typhoon that barreled through the central Philippines left at least 20 people dead and forced thousands to flee their homes, devastating Christmas celebrations in the predominantly Catholic country.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone stranded many people in sea and airports at the peak of holiday travel, set off landslides, flooded low-lying villages, destroyed houses, downed trees and electrical poles and knocked out power in entire provinces. One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly on Thursday as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph) after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the 20 deaths reported by national police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty, officials said.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power, government forecasters said.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.",

One disaster response officer described the battered coastal town of Batad in Iloilo province as a ΓÇ£ghost townΓÇ¥ on Christmas Day.\n\nΓÇ£You canΓÇÖt see anybody because there was a total blackout, you canΓÇÖt hear anything. The town looked like a ghost town,ΓÇ¥ Cindy Ferrer of the regional Office of the Civil Defense said by phone.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly on Thursday as it blew into the South China Sea with sustained winds of 120 kilometers (74 miles) per hour and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph) after lashing island after island with fierce winds and pounding rain on Christmas Day, the weather agency said.\n\nMost of the 20 deaths reported by national police and local officials were due to drowning, falling trees and accidental electrocution.\n\nA father, his three children and another relative were among those missing in hard-hit Iloilo province after a swollen river inundated their shanty, officials said.\n\nThe typhoon slammed into Eastern Samar province on Christmas Eve and then plowed across the archipelagoΓÇÖs central region on Christmas, slamming into seven coastal towns and island provinces without losing power, government forecasters said.\n\nProvincial officials, army troops, police and volunteers spent Christmas away from home to tend to thousands of displaced residents in town gymnasiums and schools turned into emergency shelters. Many more people spent Christmas Eve, traditionally a time for family reunions, in bus terminals.\n\nMore than 25,000 people were stranded in sea ports across the central region and outlying provinces after the coast guard prohibited ferries and cargo ships from venturing into dangerously choppy waters. Dozens of international and domestic flights to and from the region were canceled, including to popular beach and surfing resorts.\n\nAbout 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year. The Southeast Asian nation is also located in the Pacific ΓÇ£Ring of Fire,ΓÇ¥ where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions often occur, making the country of more than 100 million people one of the worldΓÇÖs most disaster prone.\n\nPhanfone, a Laotian word for animal, traveled along a path similar to that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million people in the central Philippines in 2013.\n\nIndonesia, Thailand mark 15th anniversary of massive tsunami\n\nby YAYAN ZAMZAMI and NINIEK KARMINI, Associated Press / Dec 26, 2019  BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) ΓÇö Thousands of people knelt in prayer in Indonesia's Aceh province at ceremonies Thursday marking the 15th anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami, one of modern history's worst natural disasters.\n\nThe massive Dec. 26, 2004, tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island. The giant wall of water killed about 230,000 people in a dozen countries as far away as East Africa. Indonesia's Aceh province, which was closest to the earthquake, was hit first and hardest.",

        "content" : "1000 stranded and 16 dead after Typhoon Phanfone batters Central Philippines\n\nPublished on : Thursday, December 26, 2019\n\nMore than 16 people were reported killed and 6 others missing after Typhoon Phanfone devastated some parts of central Philippine islands on Wednesday, that is on Christmas Day, making seven landfalls before heading out to the South China Sea.\n\nThis powerful cyclonic typhoon brought huge chaos and a wet, miserable holiday season to millions in the mainly Catholic nation. Thousands were stranded at shuttered ports, while dozens of flights were cancelled.\n\nThe images posted on social media showed some areas in Capiz and Iloilo provinces under water. Thousands were forced to evacuate before the typhoon.It is also reported that two people died in the province of Leyte, while eight were killed in Iloilo and Capiz. One died in the province of Biliran.\n\nThe Office of Civil Defense was quoted as saying that it is verifying reports of a dozen more fatalities.\n\nSix others were missing in Iloilo, although ABS-CBN television channel reported that the number could be as high as 12.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the Philippine weather agency, PAGASA, said that Phanfone was reported 155km (96 miles) west of the province of Palawan, with maximum winds of up to 130km/h (80 mph) and gustiness of up to 160km/h (99 mph).\n\nTyphoon Phanfone also hit Boracay, Coron and other holiday destinations that are famed for their white-sand beaches and popular with foreign tourists.\n\nThe airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, according to a Korean tourist who was stranded there.\n\nJung Byung Joon said that the roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty bad. Everything within 100 metres of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled. Another Korean tourist said she had been unable to make contact with her friend on Borocay.\n\nThough weaker, Phanfone was tracking a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇô the countryΓÇÖs deadliest cyclone on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013. The Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific cyclone belt.\n\nAs such, the archipelago is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, killing many people, wiping out harvests, homes and other infrastructure, and keeping millions perennially poor.\n\nA July 2019 study by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank said the more frequent storms lop 1 percent off the Philippine economic output, while the stronger ones cut output by nearly 3 percent.",

        "content" : "Una nuova sciagura ambientale si abbatte sulle Filippine. I turisti nella famosa isola delle vacanze filippine di Boracay sono stati bloccati gioved├¼ dopo un tifone che si ├¿ abbattuto l├¼ il giorno di Natale, uccidendo almeno 16 persone in altre parti del paese. Il tifone Phanfone, con raffiche di vento che raggiungono i 200 chilometri allΓÇÖora, ha strappato i tetti dalle case e ha rovesciato le poste elettriche mentre ha attraversato le Filippine centrali mercoled├¼.\n\nAlmeno 16 persone sono state uccise nei villaggi e nelle citt├á dei Visayas, nella parte centrale delle Filippine, secondo i funzionari dellΓÇÖagenzia per i disastri. Phanfone ha anche colpito Boracay, Coron e altre destinazioni turistiche famose per le loro spiagge di sabbia bianca e popolari tra i turisti stranieri. Mercoled├¼ scorso, durante la tempesta, le reti telefoniche e lΓÇÖaccesso a Internet su Boracay sono stati interrotti e sono rimaste bloccate fino a gioved├¼, rendendo difficile la valutazione del danno.\n\nΓÇ£Le linee di comunicazione sono inattive. LΓÇÖelettricit├á ├¿ ancora inattivaΓÇ¥, ha detto ad AFP Jonathan Pablito, capo della polizia della citt├á malese nella provincia di Aklan, che si trova su unΓÇÖisola vicina a Boracay. Pablito ha detto che i servizi di traghetto tra Boracay e Aklan ΓÇô il modo principale di viaggiare da e per lΓÇÖisola delle vacanze ΓÇô non erano ancora attivi gioved├¼, anche se la tempesta era passata.\n\nLΓÇÖaeroporto nella citt├á di Kalibo ad Aklan, che serve Boracay, ├¿ stato gravemente danneggiato, secondo un turista coreano che ├¿ stato bloccato l├¼ e ha fornito immagini allΓÇÖAFP. ΓÇ£Le strade rimangono bloccate, sono stati fatti alcuni sforzi per ovviare ai danni ma sono messe maleΓÇ¥, ha detto Jung Byung Joon tramite Instagram Messenger. ΓÇ£Tutto a meno di 100 metri dallΓÇÖaeroporto sembra rotto. Ci sono molte persone frustrate allΓÇÖaeroporto poich├⌐ i voli sono stati cancellatiΓÇ¥.\n\nΓÇ£I taxi sono ancora in funzione ma cΓÇÖ├¿ vento e piove ancora, quindi nessuno vuole lasciare lΓÇÖaeroporto, incluso me.ΓÇ¥ UnΓÇÖ altra turista coreano bloccato allΓÇÖaeroporto danneggiato ha dichiarato di non essere stato in grado di entrare in contatto con la sua amica gioved├¼ a Borocay. ΓÇ£Oggi ho provato a chiamarla ma non sono riuscito a raggiungerla. Forse qualcosa non funzionaΓÇ¥, ha detto Dahae Gong ad AFP tramite Instagram. ΓÇ£Non so quando potr├▓ andare a casaΓÇ¥.\n\nSebbene molto pi├╣ debole, Phanfone ha seguito un percorso simile a quello del Super Typhoon Haiyan, la tempesta pi├╣ mortale del paese che ha lasciato pi├╣ di 7.300 persone morte o disperse nel 2013. ΓÇ£├ê come il fratello pi├╣ giovane di Haiyan. ├ê meno distruttivo, ma ha seguito un percorso simileΓÇ¥, ha detto a AFP Cindy Ferrer, un funzionario di informazione dellΓÇÖufficio catastrofico della regione di Visayas occidentale.\n\nDecine di migliaia di persone nella nazione prevalentemente cattolica sono state costrette a evacuare le loro case mercoled├¼, rovinando le celebrazioni natalizie. Molti altri non sono stati in grado di tornare dalle loro famiglie, con i traghetti e i servizi aerei sospesi. Tra le vittime di Phanfone cΓÇÖ├¿ un ufficiale di polizia fulminato da un palo rovesciato mentre pattugliava. Le Filippine sono la prima grande massa terrestre di fronte alla cintura del tifone del Pacifico ed ├¿ colpita in media da circa 20 grandi tempeste allΓÇÖanno. Molte delle tempeste sono mortali e in genere spazzano via raccolti, case e infrastrutture, mantenendo milioni di persone perenni povere.",

        "content" : "Manila: Tourists on the popular Philippine holiday island of Boracay were stranded on Thursday after a typhoon swept across on Christmas Day, killing at least 16 people in other parts of the county.\n\nTyphoon Phanfone, with wind gusts reaching 200 kilometres (125 miles) an hour, tore roofs off houses and toppled electric posts as it ripped through the central Philippines on Wednesday.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed in villages and towns in the Visayas, the central third of the Philippines, according to disaster agency officials.\n\nPhanfone also hit Boracay, Coron and other holiday destinations that are famed for their white-sand beaches and popular with foreign tourists.\n\nMobile phone and internet access on Boracay was cut during the storm on Wednesday and the networks remained down on Thursday, making assessment of the damage there difficult.\n\nΓÇ£Still, communication lines are down. Electricity is still down,ΓÇ¥ told Jonathan Pablito, police chief of Malay town in Aklan province, which is on a neighbouring island to Boracay.\n\nPablito said ferry services between Boracay and Aklan ΓÇô the main way to travel to and from the holiday island ΓÇô were still not operating on Thursday, even though the storm had passed.\n\nΓÇ£We have no news from coast guard if ships were allowed to sail. Since the 24th. all those going to the island and coming from the island werenΓÇÖt able to cross.ΓÇ¥\n\nThe airport at Kalibo town in Aklan, which services Boracay, was badly damaged, according to a Korean tourist who was stranded there and provided images to AFP.\n\nΓÇ£Roads remain blocked, but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty bad,ΓÇ¥ Jung Byung Joon said via Instagram messenger.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within 100 meters of the airport looks broken. There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled.\n\nΓÇ£Taxis are still running but itΓÇÖs windy and still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, including me.ΓÇ¥\n\nAnother Korean tourist stuck at the damaged airport said she had been unable to make contact with her friend on Borocay on Thursday.\n\nΓÇ£I tried to call my friend in Boracay today and wasnΓÇÖt able to get through. Maybe something isnΓÇÖt working,ΓÇ¥ Dahae Gong told via Instagram.\n\nΓÇ£I donΓÇÖt know when I will be able to go home.ΓÇ¥\n\nStill, there was no indication of any major damage or otherwise on Boracay.\n\nThough much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan ΓÇô the countryΓÇÖs deadliest storm on record which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.\n\nΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs like the younger sibling of Haiyan. ItΓÇÖs less destructive, but it followed a similar path,ΓÇ¥ told Cindy Ferrer, an information officer at the Western Visayas regionΓÇÖs disaster bureau.\n\nTens of thousands of people in the mostly Catholic nation had been forced to evacuate their homes on Wednesday, ruining Christmas celebrations.\n\nMany others were not able to return to their families, with ferries and plane services suspended.\n\nAmong those killed in Phanfone was a police officer who was electrocuted by a toppled post while patrolling.\n\nThe Philippines is the first major landmass facing the Pacific typhoon belt, and is hit by an average of about 20 major storms a year.\n\nMany of the storms are deadly, and they typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.",

With winds of more than 193mph, it was the most powerful storm to ever make landfall.\n\nPhanfone first made landfall on Christmas Eve, but continued to pass over the many islands of the central Philippines throughout Christmas Day. However, the extent of the damage began to emerge only on December 26.\n\nLocal media say at least 10 people have died ΓÇô including a three-year-old boy ΓÇô with most deaths occurring in Iloilo and Capiz provinces.\n\nAFP quotes officials as saying that at least 16 people died.\n\nTyphoon Haiyan death toll rises to 5,209 in Philippines\n\nTyphoon Haiyan affected 11 million people in Philippines\n\nOne family was killed when they were swept away by a flash flood as they attempted to get to higher ground, the Philippine ABS-CBN network reported. It added that at least 12 people were missing in Iloilo province alone.\n\nThe popular tourist island of Boracay appears to have suffered damage, although the extent is unclear.\n\nIn the city of Tacloban, a large fire broke out as the winds rose, but the city escaped the worst of the damage.\n\nTacloban suffered enormous damage during Typhoon Haiyan when a storm surge pushed water into the low-lying city of more than 220,000 people.\n\nOn December 26, typhoon Phanfone headed out towards the South China Sea.\n\nphilippines typhoon typhoon devastation typhoon haiyan typhoon phanfone typhoon ursula Trump Impeachment: Republicans and Democrats Clash over Senate Impeachment Trial Rules\n\nNancy Clayson\n\nNancy is a young, full of life lady who joined the team shortly after the BelleNews site started to run.

        "title" : "At least 16 dead after Typhoon Phanfone",
        "content" : "At least 16 people died after the passage of Typhoon Phanfone, which swept away remote villages and tourist areas in the center of philippines, local authorities announced on Thursday.\n\nThis typhoon, which was accompanied by gusts of wind reaching 195 km / h, caused extensive material damage, tearing down roofs of houses and knocking over utility poles. In the worst hit areas, the Internet and telephone networks were still down on Thursday.\n\nBoracay and Coron islands affected\n\nAt least 16 people living in villages or towns in the Visaya group of islands in the center of the country have been killed, officials from the National Disaster Management Authority said. Phanfone hit among others the small island of Boracay (center), that from Coron (west) as well as other popular destinations for tourists, especially foreigners, for their white sandy beaches. Kalibo Airport, which serves Boracay, has suffered significant damage, according to a Korean tourist who found himself stranded. ΓÇ£The roads remain cut, but resources are being used to clear up the damage. ItΓÇÖs pretty serious, ΓÇ£said Jung Byung Joon on the Instagram social network.\n\nΓÇ£Everything within a radius of less than 100 meters around the airport appears to be damaged. At the airport, there are a lot of people disappointed because their flights have been canceled, ΓÇ£he said. ΓÇ£Taxis are running but it is windy and it is still raining so no one wants to leave the airport, especially me,ΓÇ¥ said the tourist. Although less powerful, Phanfone followed the same trajectory as Typhoon Haiyan, the most devastating recorded in the country, which killed more than 7,300 people in 2013, hitting the town of Tacloban in particular.\n\nPoliceman killed by falling electric pole\n\nΓÇ£HeΓÇÖs like HaiyanΓÇÖs little brother. It is less destructive, but it has followed a similar path, ΓÇ£said Cindy Ferrer, communications officer for the disaster management service in the Western Visayas region. In this overwhelmingly Catholic country, tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes and spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in shelters. Many Filipinos have been unable to wake up in their families due to the termination of air and ferry connections.\n\nAmong those killed was a police officer who was electrocuted by the fall of a utility pole during a patrol. The typhoon, which is weakening, was slowly moving away from the country on Thursday, heading for the South China Sea, according to the weather forecast center Weather Philippines. On average, around twenty typhoons and tropical storms sweep the Philippines every year, causing hundreds of deaths. In mid-December, a violent tropical storm in the north of the country left 13 people dead.",
